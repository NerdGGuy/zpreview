- **Detailed Explanation:**
  ICMS event website: https://www.icms.org.uk/ZeroKnowledgeProofs Summary: We will hold a Research Workshop on the Foundations and Applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs from 2-6 Sept. 2024 at the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS), University of Edinburgh, UK. This workshop will unite zero-knowledge researchers in the UK and Europe and facilitate community building, especially among PhD students and early-career researchers. The content that is presented will be published online as a lasting resource. The ultimate objective of the workshop is to have a significant long-term effect on research in zero-knowledge proofs and privacy-enhancing techniques by encouraging connections and creating resources for researchers. The workshop will cover several topics within this field, including classical results, interactive oracle proofs, proofs from symmetric primitives, group and pairing-based proof systems, such as ZK-SNARKs, lattice-based proof systems, and real-world applications. Objectives: 1. Building a community of researchers working on zero-knowledge proofs. We will bolster a growing community of zero-knowledge researchers in the UK and Europe. Attendees will benefit from interactions with world-class speakers and up-and-coming ECRs with both practical and theoretical perspectives. It is our hope that this will lead to future, ongoing collaborations between participants. This opportunity will be invaluable for the participants. 2. Library of online resources for zero-knowledge and succinct arguments. We will take advantage of the ICMS facilities to record talks. We aim to make the talks available online after the event, to reach as wide an audience as possible. This will augment existing resources such as [1], which will be 5 years old by the time of the workshop, and [2], most parts of which are aimed at existing experts in zero-knowledge. We will release an online “things you need to know” pre-recorded talk in advance of the workshop, to ensure participants are familiar with required background material. 3. Increase diversity and inclusion. We recognise the importance of increasing diversity in mathematics and cyber security. Out of 11 expert speakers, 5 are female (F) and several are early-career researchers (ECRs). We seek to enable even very early-career participants (e.g., PhD students) to take an active role in the event. We are passionate about organising a workshop that makes these fundamental concepts and techniques approachable for diverse backgrounds, through enlightening presentations and material. Content and Structure: 1. Lectures :​ We plan to divide the workshop into 6 categories: (1) Introduction and surveys (including classical results from the 1980-90s and recent application-driven motivation), (2) Interactive Oracle Proofs (IOPs) and Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs), (3) ZK from Symmetric Key Primitives (including hash-based and MPC-in-the-head-based constructions), (4) Group/Pairing-based ZK and SNARKs, (5) Lattice-based ZK, and (6) Applications (including anonymous credentials / cash). We will finalise the specific areas to cover closer to the time, to ensure the workshop is maximally relevant. Categories (1) and (2) form foundations of more advanced ZK algorithms covered in the rest of the workshop. Algorithms from category (4) have been deployed in real-world systems, such as blockchains, and thus we plan to have a hands-on lab session where participants learn how to use ZK libraries in production. 2. Lightning talks :​ We plan to call for lightning talks to be presented at the workshop, alongside the invited presentations and talks on relevant topics. This will allow all participants an opportunity to share their current research and will help to facilitate our aim of building community among our participants. 3. Networking/social opportunities :​ To further achieve our aim of building a community, we will provide structured socials. This will help attendees to get to know each other more informally. A potential structured social is a “research area mixer” where the invited speakers spend some time discussing with several smaller groups. This allows everyone a chance to meet the speakers, and facilitates interactions that might not have occurred otherwise.

- **Recording:**
  Yes
- **Benefit to Zcash:**
  The workshop will increase interest and knowledge in zero-knowledge proofs and their applications among early-career researchers and cryptography engineers, and promote collaboration with and inside the community. This will benefit the zero-knowledge research community and the companies working in the zero-knowledge space, including the Zcash community. The lectures will also be recorded as a long-lasting resource.
- **Other Funding:**
  The International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) at the University of Edinburgh, UK has committed £24,000 of funding for this event. Following the ICMS cost recommendations for accommodation (£100 per day), catering (£150 per week), and travel expenses within Europe (roughly £300 roundtrip) ( https://www.icms.org.uk/financial-support-available-icms-activity ), the cost per person is roughly £950 when traveling within Europe. The funding of £24,000 from the ICMS covers all expenses for the organizers and the invited speakers, as well as accommodation and catering for 15 attendees. The 15 attendees need to pay registration of £150 per person and cover individual travel expenses.
