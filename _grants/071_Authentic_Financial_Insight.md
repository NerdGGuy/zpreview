- **Project Summary:**
  Zingo will provide authentic and unique insight into your financial history.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Zingo Lab Viridian is building a technology, not just for Zcash specialists, cryptocurrency experts or power users, but for everyone. Users are rapidly adopting technologies that help them visualize their financial behaviour(1). However, these modern 'fintech' providers all suffer the following issues:
   Tradeoffs between personalization and privacy(2)
   Outdated and outsourced technology that cannot provide a useful consolidated picture
- **Proposed solution:**
  Zingo Lab Viridian's vision for a truly authentic form of financial insight - or 'finsight' - not only provides a solution to these issues but lays the foundations for a safer and more insightful approach to financial awareness. These innovations for insight stem from an assurance of exclusivity that is a unique feature of Zcash-based applications. The guarantee that the user is the only recipient of that finsight. Any system that fails to provide this form of finsight, cannot be deemed authentic.
   Know your values, know your Self.
- **Solution Format:**
  A user facing application available on Android and ios devices, as well as linux systems.
- **Dependencies:**
  We depend on the mobile device application stores. As an integrated Lab we produce and maintain in-production user-facing applications (Zingo) and contribute to the underlying technologies necessary to provide Users with the services they need. In order to achieve our aims for Zingo we require the production of new technologies. In particular all of our milestones are contingent on efficient operation of Zingo, in various environments. MileStone 2 depends on an implementation of Orchard-Receiver based message signing. MileStone 3 depends on a high-level Rust API to a shielded threshold signature scheme. We intend to contribute to projects that provide these requirements (e.g. FROST, DAG-sync). In particular we intend to leverage the expertise we've built integrating Orchard to integrate these related novel technologies.
- **Technical approach:**
  We'll continue to build on and refine our successful approach of pair-programming, and test driven development. Since we now have an application that's in production we'll devote a flexible but consistently non-zero engineering effort to "devops" and crucially, we'll be partnering dynamically and in a fine-grained way with a broad-array of sub-contractors.

### Requested Grant Amount

- **Amount:**
  375000.0

### Budget Breakdown

- **Hardware/Software budget:**
  0.0
- **Hardware/Software justification:**
  This is a relatively small portion of our ask, but since some members of our team live in restrictive regimes we won't disclose the exact amount.
- **Services budget:**
  0.0
- **Services justification:**
  This is a relatively small portion of our ask, but since some members of our team live in restrictive regimes we won't disclose the exact amount.
- **Compensation budget:**
  0.0
- **Compensation justification:**
  This is a relatively small portion of our ask, but since some members of our team live in restrictive regimes we won't disclose the exact amount.
- **Startup funding required:**
  Yes
- **Startup funding explanation:**
  The ZingoLabs crew has been continuously developing new features since at least April of last year. Please see: * https://github.com/zingolabs/zingolib/graphs/contributors * https://github.com/zingolabs/zingo-mobile/graphs/contributors for a few reference points. Of course, the most important source of insight into our work is our deployed application available on ios and Android. In order to maintain, and increase our velocity, we're asking for a generous up-front commitment from the community that we'll use to: * upgrade hardware * facilitate an in-person hackathon of the core team * hire, and compensate a rapidly expanding community of consultants without whom we'd be a much less successful enterprise

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Zingo Lab Viridian
- **Background:**
  Who We Are 
   Zingo Lab Viridian is a distrubuted organization that is innovating on zcash and empowering its users. We built Orchard address sending-and-receiving in the full UA protocol, NU5 formats, and memos-as-infrastructure. Now, in collaboration with the wider Zcash Community, we're innovating on that expertise to produce an ergonomic blockchain interface that empowers people to have a healthy relationship with their money and technology.

### Funding History

  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  We depend on the mobile device application stores. This work will be taking place concurrently with R&D efforts by Zingo Lab Viridian
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  Users will become more responsible for the custody of their wealth, if they adopt the finsight paradigm we're advocating. There are significant and obvious risks this poses. If users prefer Zingo to the exclusion of other wallets there's a potential to diminish the diversity of the wallet/zcash-application space. As with any zcash application, disruptive levels of adoption would force fundamental reconfigurations of financial systems.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  As a user-facing application Zingo has an extremely intuitive success metric: "Usage". That having been said we aspire to hit a higher bar: Novel adoption of a zcash technology by previously naive users. Given that objective we intend to solicit feedback from Zingo installers via the app store, to estimate the number of new-to-zcash installers. Per Milestone Details: MileStone 1: Basic Finsight Deliverables: 1. The User can interact with different representations of the transaction history, associated with a seed interactive graphics (pie-chart/time-series) across recipients graphed against: amount of value, number of transactions, amount of memo-data 2. The User can interact with different representations of the transaction history, associated with a Viewing Key as above but with a viewing key MileStone 2: ShardTree Based Sync 1. The User opens their mobile application and it begins syncing to the blockchain using the ShardTree structure from librustzcash to more efficiently update witnesses. sync speed is faster 2. Major upgrades to code quality and test infrastructure that makes rapid development possible MileStone 3: Background Sync, Even More Basic, ZIP317, Nym Wallet UI Mockup, Zebra Regtest Android Background Sync in Android Mobile Devices ZIP317 iOS Background Sync in iOS Mobile Devices an upgraded Basic (Even More Basic) Mode to facilitate new User on-board regtest mode implementation in zebrad to facilitate deprecation of zcashd new wallet UI, and streamlining to integrate Nym privacy into the wallet (this does NOT include necessary work on the server-side, or Rust library components, which must be funded by other sources) new zingo-mobile UI, unauthenticated address books mobile-screen lock functionality
