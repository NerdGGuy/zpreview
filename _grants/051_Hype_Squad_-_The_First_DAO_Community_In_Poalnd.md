- **Project Summary:**
  We are building the first polish community around blockchain and Web3 technology on various social media channels

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  In Poland, there are a lot of people who want to enter the web3 world but the knowledge is really hard to find and we need more educational materials right now. The main goal is education around: knowledge, career, business development, and investment. The project is set up for the long term, and we are presenting a plan for first 12 months. Benefits: - educated people ready to start work in web3 (developers, business managers, marketing, HR, PR, UX/UI etc.) - Businessmen will have interesting opportunities and enter their existing business from web2 to web3 - New projects and initiatives in web3 because people will understand the idea and possibilities - People start investing in web3 startups, tokens, NFT, Gamefi, DeFi, metaverse, new technology
- **Proposed solution:**
  There is a huge demand in Poland on educational content in web3, and there needs to be more it. Our team has experience; people have used to work in web3 startups for 1-2 years and more by also producing educational content. And from January, we will start an educational program cooperating with Warsaw government entities. I agreed with Warsaw government entities to host a 1h presentation in 100 high schools in Warsaw about Web3 - it will be the leading way to reach out to new DAO members and future blockchain users at the beginning. It gives me around 500 students and 50 teachers reach per school - 55000 in total. Presentations will start in January 2023.

- **Dependencies:**
  So we are negotiating terms of cooperating with Warsaw government entities to set up educational programs for high schools. We would like to cooperate with web3 projects, and make interviews with ppl from the c-level and not only.
- **Technical approach:**
  Besides education, we will introduce a new paradigm for the web2 community, which is DAO.

### Funding History

- **Previous funding:**
  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  In Poland, we have a few Polish-based NFT projects, but they do not educate people + we have an "NFT Polska" community, but they are more focused on NFT flipping etc. Social media algorithms can block promotion and content about crypto and web3, lower interest in web3 among young people than we are predicting (our prediction in 2-4%).
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  We are an educational community-driven project.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  From the school campaign, we want to reach around 2-4% enrollment conversion (1100-2200 members) but during this campaign, we will produce content, giveaways and promos. And we estimate that the size of the community on the discord will be at least 5000 members. Community/Project KPI Q1 2023 - 5000 users on discord - First partnerships in web3 - First IRL community event Q2 2023 - first partnerships in web2 - finished lectures in the top 100 high schools in Warsaw - First AMA with web3 founder - Full DAO organization set up Q3 2023 - first partnership with blockchain event - partnership with IT companies and hackathons - first community investment in the web3 project Q4 2023 - web3 talent acquisition server - community launchpad (supporting community ideas) - first web3 event organized by the community
