- **Project Summary:**
  A Greek Community for Zcash and increased participation in the Project.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Greece is a country that has suffered extremely as a result of the financial crisis. Despite the repayment of IMF loans granted as aid during the financial crisis, Greece's debt situation remains precarious. Public debt reached a new record at the end of 2020. The Corona pandemic is setting the country far behind in debt reduction. In some countries it will take much longer to build a community than in others. This is due to the size of the population, the cost of living (i.e. what you still have available for financial investments), the willingness to take risks and much more.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Our main medium to overcome these difficulties of low participation of the Greek community in the cryptocurrency space is to provide correct and accurate information through a familiar community in their native language.
- **Solution Format:**
  A Greek Community for Zcash, a page on our blog and increased participation in the Project.
- **Dependencies:**
  Our project is independent and does not require the involvement of other organizations. The latter is not applicable.
- **Technical approach:**
  Our strategy is to publish translated blog posts from the original Zcash blog and user oriented tutorials based on the documentation of Zcash. Regular posting on our Twitter account. We also plan to provide support for users on our Discord server.

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  Our project is based on a solidly structured community. As far as the difficulties of participation and engagement that exist when a new community begins, we have overcome them in the past. We are now able to confidently express that the Greek audience will embrace Zcash technology through our project.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  With the achievement of our project we believe that there will be only positive outcomes. Greek participants in Zcash will increase and a positive and familiar perception of Zcash will be formed by the Greek people. Moreover, there will be a solid Greek community where people will be informed about the new developments of Zcash and the team working behind this project.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Our metrics for success include: page views, page subscribers, Twitter impressions and the increased participation of Greek people in Zcash.
