- **Project Summary:**
  Proposal to Create a Catchy Song/Jingle for Zcash with a Music Video.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Cryptocurrency has been gaining popularity in recent times and is witnessing a remarkable expansion in its user base. However, even with its growing reach, there remains a gap between the kind of public awareness that exists, and the kind that may ideally be needed to ensure deeper and wider penetration of cryptocurrency in general, and Zcash in particular. For the masses to appreciate the kind of powerful tech and privacy solutions that Zcash offers, they need to understand both the benefits and the challenges of being a cryptocurrency user. What we need is a conversation starter, and it has been proven time and again, that nothing starts a conversation like music. To make people sit up and take notice, we first need to capture their attention in the simplest way possible. A well-composed, targeted jingle/original theme song is the easiest way to achieve this objective. Brands worldwide have been relying on impactful jingles to create a lasting and memorable brand, and generate the much-needed buzz and curiosity around their offerings. Zcash is relevant, important, and ahead of the curve in all the ways that matter. What we need is to figure out a way to capture its essence in a way that is enigmatic and memorable in the right proportions.
- **Proposed solution:**
  I propose to create a jingle/original theme song for Zcash that will be hummable as it would be memorable, and most importantly, it would be composed and produced in a way that will ensure that the target audience becomes both aware and curious about Zcash. The jingle will be accompanied by a finely conceived music video that will once again focus on grabbing eyeballs as much as capturing the essence of Zcash, and its undeniable relevance for its users in the current environment. To enhance the chances of potential virality, the song will then also be made available under Creative Commons for all the community users and audience to experiment with and create their own fun videos, TikToks and reels around it, thus adding to the buzz and the conversations around Zcash.
- **Solution Format:**
  1. Original Song for Zcash on my Youtube Channel with a music video (3-4 min length) 2. The audio will then be available for all for free to download and use under creative commons licenses - Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International 3. The song will also be made available on Tiktok, Instagram, and Facebook so people can create their own short videos with it.
- **Dependencies:**
  None. The jingle including the associated video will be wholly written, composed, produced, programmed, edited, acted, directed and distributed by me and my team. There are zero external dependencies. As far as incorporation is concerned, I will be distributing the jingle to all the relevant platform under Creative Commons (Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International) to ensure they are available for other creators within and beyond the community for creative integration on their own respective platforms.
- **Technical approach:**
  Writing the song with a unique hook line and Zcash in it. Arranging, recording, and producing the song. Mixing and mastering the track to industry standard. Creating a video of the song with me performing it. Distributing it on my YouTube Channel. Distributing it on other streaming platforms like Spotify & Apple Music. Distributing it on Tiktok& Insta Reels. Sharing it with the community everywhere and encouraging them to create their own videos around the song.
