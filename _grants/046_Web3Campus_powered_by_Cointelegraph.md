### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Our goal is to supply the Web3 market with professionals capable to build and grow projects through cutting-edge solutions. We aim to solve the problem of difficult field immersion and fill the lack of professionals and teams with high-quality execution.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Please find the link to our deck here: https://docsend.com/view/i37fnbgqsnj8gxvs Web3Campus is an online educational platform for learning Web3 skills and professions. As a result, Web2 developers can seamlessly acquire necessary skills, learn from Web3 top performers, and share their own expertise. We will provide students with a safe place to learn in a real-work simulator with all tools they need to train. W3C is where the traditional EdTech business model meets Web3 mechanics like Learn-to-Earn will be built on the Zcash network. This way, the technologies of the Zcash ecosystem will be at the base of ‘Web3-vizing’ the EdTech market.
- **Solution Format:**
  Courses and other educational materials related to Zcash, W3C Digital Identity built on Zcash, rewards for Contribute2Earn and Learn2Earn paid in ZEC.
- **Dependencies:**
  Our project is fully governed by its core team. We need financial support for product and marketing purposes to build materials fully devoted to Zcash. With efficient learning methodology and Web3 mechanics, we will accelerate the adoption of Zcash ecosystem for Web2 developers. The result of our partnership will be 1K new builders and creators for Zcash.
- **Technical approach:**
  Courses and Quests fully related to Zcash - How to build DeFi projects course; two mini-courses and two quests. Learn2Earn - Reward mechanics to stimulate students to use Zcash infrastructure tools, increase course completion and encourage the best students. W3C:Jobs and Digital Identity - Decentralized Identity for student’s traction and company-employee interaction built on Zcash blockchain. Contribute2Earn - Reward mechanics to incentivize users to create content, tasks, and guides. Marketing of Zcash Courses only and support of students - Performance and content marketing, community growth, influencers, and webinars. Rewards for L2E & C2E - Rewards in ZEC to incentivize our users.

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  Our biggest challenge is ensuring high quality of Contribute2Earn content. One of our platform’s features is encouraging users to create educational materials and share their experiences. Nonetheless, to guarantee their reliability and usefulness, we need to come up with some content-approval mechanics. We are going to overcome this by automated filtering our users by their portfolio: their past experience (W3C Digital Identity feature is going to be helpful), number of successful courses completed, and their historical digital footprint on W3C (comments, help on other students’ issues). That would separate “good” students from spammers.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  N/A
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Number of users on Zcash-related courses - 1K till Mar ‘23 Number of pieces of contribution (reviews, articles, tutorials, advice) produced by users within Contribute2Earn mechanics - 10K monthly Number of companies registered in W3C:JOBS that are looking for candidates on our platform - 2.5K till Sep ‘23
