### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The opportunity: Zcash is the industry leader in privacy technology, zero-knowledge development and peer-to-peer payment protocols. But, it struggles with education and documentation geared towards end-users. It also struggles with giving non-technical community members an easy way to contribute to Zcash and earn ZEC. From Ian, ZecHub’s founder:
  
   Since joining the Zcash ecosystem as a contributor, I found that there was a lot of FUD around simple things like shielded wallet applications, how to use Zcash privately, and other relatively simple topics. I also saw that a lot of the education and media platforms were dependent on a single individual or entity, and I thought to myself: what if that platform ceased to receive funding, or the person left the project? I remembered EthHub from the Ethereum ecosystem and its purpose: Dispel FUD, make Ethereum easy to understand and do it in an open-source environment. I decided to take that model and apply it to the Zcash ecosystem, with a strong emphasis on open-source and decentralization. I focused on the latter aspect to ensure that ZecHub never died if I, or anyone else, decided they didn’t want to continue on with the project. I also noticed there was an opportunity for Zcash to bring on some of Ethereum’s principles with regards to DAO-like working structures. In Ethereum there are a lot of environments where you can join an organization’s chat room, provide value, and earn some crypto. ZecHub has the opportunity to be Zcash’s primary education platform and resource, while also giving Zcashers more purpose through contributing to the hub. And even with ZecHub being a passion project so far, other cryptocurrency communities are starting to recommend ZecHub as a go-to channel to learn more about Zcash.
  
  With funding and more structure, ZecHub can be the platform that makes Zcash education simple, inclusive and unique.
- **Proposed solution:**
  ZecHub provides easy to understand education resources, a newsletter and a podcast on Zcash-specific materials. It does this in an open-source manner.
  
  The beauty of ZecHub is that anyone can review the documentation for accuracy, create new materials and use the hub’s structure to facilitate new ideas that benefit the hub’s education stack and the Zcash ecosystem. ZecHub thrives on open-source contributions. We believe this is a feature, not a bug. We propose a pool of funds that is overseen by the DAO, and rewards contributors for every contribution made to ZecHub. We believe this process will incentivize current community members to become more active contributors to Zcash education, and adjacent crypto ecosystem communities to come in and learn about Zcash and eventually contribute to the protocol. ZecHub focuses on advancing Zcash education and will provide a uniform process for anyone to earn ZEC.
- **Solution Format:**
  The format of the work will be: An easy to understand Zcash wikipedia Zcash’s weekly newsletter Consistent Zcash education for crypto twitter News shows, podcasts and other video content for social media Zcash wallet tutorials (video) Zcash user guides Twitter spaces series Easy to understand articles about Zcash Zcash media in multiple languages Media about other privacy projects (i.e. Railgun podcast), which can introduce them to ZecHub Contributor onboarding docs, make working on Zcash easy See some of our past work: A podcast with David from Zcash Media A tutorial on how to access funds in Ywallet A recent edition of the newsletter An easy to understand blog on z-addrs and t-addrs A podcast episode with Railgun A wiki doc on FROST A Zcash news show A wiki doc on Halo A Raspberry Pi 4 zcashd full node user guide A community spotlight wiki doc on CPZ A wiki section on using ZEC Social media thread on self-custody
- **Dependencies:**
  The podcast is dependent on Zcash community members being open to attending the podcast. ZecHub is dependent on its DAO members and open-source contributors to see the platform thrive. There are no other dependencies.
- **Technical approach:**
  Starting in January 2023: Contributor onboarding doc to help onboard new Zcash contributors We manage the ecosystems only weekly newsletter Open-sourced education materials. Anyone can contribute. We believe we should standardize bounty amounts in ZEC to making earning ZEC consistent, worthwhile and normal We have created an efficient process for podcast guests and creating content We have a community-led DAO to ensure the hub’s strategic direction includes a diverse set of voices We will vote on all major changes related to the Hub, and will document those changes in public We believe in collaboration. Anyone can use our materials to support their own channels. For example, Zcash en Español.

   Creative content for social - .75 ZEC per creative posted on ZecHub socials
   This page has a more detailed explanation of the contributor bounty fund.
  
  Total of costs for 2023 bounty pool - 270 ZEC. (12,082.50 USD as of 1/17/23) Legal costs: Startup Counsel Costs: $5250 Immediate Counsel Assistance: $12,250 Total estimated legal costs: $5550 with $12,250 additional budget reserved for startup costs. We also request that the ZF reserve $100,000 for further legal and compliance expenses. ZecHub will draw on this reserve on an itemized basis, as necessary. Note on legal costs We’re currently speaking with some of the top lawyers in the crypto industry to navigate the complexities of incorporating a DAO. Unfortunately, incorporating outside of the US is extremely expensive, so likely, we will have to incorporate in the US. The primary reason for incorporation is to ensure that the DAO members are not liable for tax events incurred from open-source bounty payouts. To help us through that process, we will need outside counsel that will help us incorporate the DAO, and ensure that its members will not incur any personal liabilities. This is the initial budget for $5250. This should be all we need. DAO legal structures are unfortunately difficult to navigate, so an extra legal cost in the beginning might also need to be accounted for. We are budgeting an additional $12,250 in case we need more funds for legal expenses in the beginning. In the long-term, we are requesting a legal retainer budget in the event that ZecHub needs additional legal counsel. We do not expect this to be the case. All legal costs will be managed and paid out by the Zcash Foundation upon receipt.

### Funding History

- **Previous funding:**
  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The biggest execution risk has been a lack of funding and attention dedicated towards the hub. Still, it has proven its value to Zcash. ZCG funding, and dedicated contributors, solve for this risk.
  
  Other risks could involve the hub’s information being free to use, potentially creating competitors instead of collaborators. But, we have not seen this play out in practice and doubt it will.
  
  Another education risk is the hub’s dependency on one person for media materials. There should be a strong focus on developing more content creators for the hub.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  If successful, Zcash users will become more educated -- no negative ramifications.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  The main metrics related to ZecHub’s success are social media metrics (followers, video views, newsletter subscribers, etc) and the number of contributors building ZecHub related items. Here are the metrics from ZecHub’s first 6 months: Primary Social Media Following: Twitter - 386 followers YouTube - 115 subscribers Newsletter - 50 subscribers Social Media Engagement: A high level overview. We average 2-10k Impressions per post on twitter. Our podcast has relatively good views with nearly 900 over 5 episodes. Ian also experimented with posting content on his personal account, and retweeting via ZecHub, with the most successful post having 34,000 impressions and 8,000 video views. We feel that our engagement suffers because we do not consistently post, and our social media has largely been experimental. Saying that, many feel that ZecHub has a quality brand, and has consistently delivered quality social media content. Posts include Hub announcements, docs updates, newsletters, podcasts, news shows, tutorials, and threads based on user experience.
  
  We are in a bear market, and we feel that if we can increase consistency, maintain engagement numbers, and grow our social media following along the way, then we would have a successful year in this regard. 
  
  We will also post content that appeals to crypto ecosystems outside the Zcash community. For example, doing a podcast with the Railgun team brought more eyes on ZecHub from the Railgun community. If we do this frequently, with ecosystems that are aligned with Zcash, we can grow our following and engagement outside of Zcash. We believe this will bring more people to ZecHub as followers and potential contributors. This widens the net for potential engagement and growth on social media.
  
  We will provide a monthly social media report for the community. You can view our main social media channels below:
  
   Twitter 
  
   YouTube 
  
   Substack 
  
   Contributor Count: ZecHub has had 13 Zcashers contribute to the hub. We believe this is the most important metric, because it can give Zcashers added purpose for the work.
  
  We view everything, docs, podcasts, social media, etc., as a means to bring in committed contributors to Zcash. When these contributors are actively playing their part in Zcash education, they will have more things to post about Zcash on social media, in their online communities, IRL, and this will amplify ZecHub and Zcash’s work past our own follower base.
  
  The best crypto communities are where people can come in, contribute and truly be a part of something. How bad is it when you enter a discord, want to provide value to something you care about, but there’s no way to do it? Our goal for 2023 is to see 17 new Zcashers contribute to ZecHub, bringing its contributor count to 30. This will be done via our contributor onboarding process, and community management.
