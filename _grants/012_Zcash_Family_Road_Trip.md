  Teaching Our Family About Crypto & Investing / Building Awareness Through Visibility & Dialogue For Zcash

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The problem is that not too many people know about zcash. As we all know cryptocurrency is still very new and most people only know of bitcoin and MAYBE ethereum. But there is so much more to learn, and we can get ahead of the curve by promoting zcash in cool ways so that the public knows who we are and what we are about. If we can touch more people and have more conversations about zcash and what it has to offer, then we can build an even stronger community and a stronger coin in general. A moving billboard through 14 major cities would be a sure-fire way to get the ball rolling.
- **Proposed solution:**
  The solution is getting out there and hitting the road with a beautiful luxury vehicle that draws attention, especially with the eye-catching logos that zcash has. This is an awesome form of marketing where visibility will make a huge difference as well as getting people in the know about zcash. The major cities we plan to visit will have millions of eyes on the zcash promo vehicle and it will absolutely turn heads. My goal is to increase shareholders and community users significantly by taking this cross-country trip and this will add to the strength of zcash as a whole because people will remember the name and the fact that they saw this vehicle which will stand out so well. I plan on going with an all-black suv with the bright yellow zcash logos (guaranteed to catch attention and stand out).
- **Solution Format:**
  My two main key factors of my solution would be dialogue and visibility. The average person does not know what zcash is and if they did (and actually understood the use case) I'm sure they would hold some zcash and/ or start making purchases with it versus the traditional ways to send money and pay for items from merchants. We are still very early in cryptocurrency, and it is all about raising the awareness as much as we can.
- **Dependencies:**
  In this case we would only need zcash to remain a top privacy coin in the space and continue innovating and empowering the community in the way that they have been doing. We will be sure to do our part by being visible everywhere and having open dialogue about zcash in every city we visit.
- **Technical approach:**
  In a nutshell I would be taking my family of 5 on the road to promote zcash! We have two boys ages 13 & 11, and we just had our first baby girl who is 1.5 months old. We are currently teaching our children about finances and investing, and this trip would only be adding to that teaching! I believe this is the perfect opportunity for both parties to benefit. We are hitting 14 major cities that are listed below where we will touch the people and talk about zcash as much as possible. The vehicle will be a beautiful talk piece and i will be answering any questions people may have, helping them sign up for the wallet, etc. A zcash vehicle passing through these major cities is excellent promotion and builds awareness. It will be one huge, moving billboard with bright yellow zcash logos catching attention everywhere we go. We will record names and emails of people who sign up for the wallet on the spot. I plan to make a major difference in the trajectory of zcash and the future of this company. It is one that i believe will stand the test of time.

### Requested Grant Amount

- **Amount:**
  232000.0

### Budget Breakdown

- **Hardware/Software budget:**
  120000.0
- **Hardware/Software justification:**
  Hardware in this scenario would be the S.U.V. vehicle itself. We wanted to choose a vehicle that can fit our entire family, is up to date with all of the best features to make the trip more comfortable / safe, as well as something reliable that is not known for having many problems on the road. After extensive research and comparison, we chose the lx 600 f sport by Lexus. Sticker price is 103,000$ we are factoring in any taxes as well as vehicle accessories we may need as well.
- **Services budget:**
  12000.0
- **Services justification:**
  Services would include the vehicle wrapping. Professional custom wrapping for a vehicle this size can range from $8,000 to $12,000.
- **Compensation budget:**
  100000.0
- **Compensation justification:**
  Compensation budget will cover all expenses for a family of 5 on a 1.5-month trip to 14 cities. Cities: Charlotte, NC Atlanta, GA Savannah, GA Orlando, FL Miami, FL Naples, FL Tampa, FL New Orleans, LA Houston, TX Dallas, TX OKC Denver, CO Las Vegas, NV Los Angeles, CA This will include fuel, maintenance (tires/oil changes/emergencies), food, hotels / air bnb, events, and toiletries.
- **Startup funding required:**
  Yes
- **Startup funding explanation:**
  Startup funding is simple. We would need the funding for the vehicle purchase and wrapping of the vehicle. We are going to get the suv professionally wrapped with zcash logos, website information and how to download the wallet. Once we have the vehicle purchased, ready and wrapped, we can move forward with the additional funding for the actual trip itself.
- **Startup funding amount:**
  132000.0
- **Total proposed grant value:**
  232000.0

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Stephen H.
- **Background:**
  Hello, my name is Stephen Holloway. I run a mobile computer repair service in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have had my business for 3 years and we are still new. But i have been repairing computers for over 12 years. I plan to make zcash my preferred method of payment at my business and will offer discounts and incentives if used for my services. My other hobbies are photography, hiking, and graphic design. I work directly with customers daily so my people skills are up to par and i can sell / promote almost anything. I am a current cryptocurrency investor / miner as well and a fan of zcash for the convenience and privacy that they provide. As well as the strong community behind zcash. I would love the opportunity to build awareness and shed light on this company while acting as a brand ambassador and advocate.

### Funding History

- **Previous funding:**
  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  My execution risks for this project would only be having car trouble or a fender bender on the road. If we can avoid anything like that, then the trip will be a success no doubt. We regularly take family trips in this fashion so I am optimistic that everything will go smooth.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  I am not expecting any negative consequences for this project. I do hope that our government will continue to let our coin as well as other privacy coins stay that way. We have a right to our privacy and what we choose to do with our money.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Once we are all done with this project, we will share our amazing experiences with the community on how effective we thought it was to promote zcash in such a way, and how the following will noticeably increase if we keep doing unique promotions and marketing such as this. It's all about getting out there and interacting with the people and teaching them about what we have to offer, and I intend to do just that.

### Project Timeline

- **Project timeline determination:**
  We are factoring in the time it takes to find the correct vehicle and ample time for the vehicle to be wrapped with the zcash logos and website / app information. Once we are actually on the road, we will spend 2-3 days in each city. Totaling about 1.5 months.
