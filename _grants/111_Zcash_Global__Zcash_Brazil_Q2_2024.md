### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Cryptocurrency is important in Brazil for several reasons. Firstly, it provides an alternative financial system for individuals who may be excluded from traditional banking services, offering financial inclusion to a significant portion of the population. Additionally, Brazil has faced economic instability and high inflation in the past, leading people to seek more stable and decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies as a store of value. The country also grapples with a complex banking infrastructure, and cryptocurrencies offer a more accessible and efficient means of transferring funds domestically and internationally. Moreover, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies aligns with the desire for greater financial autonomy and privacy. As Brazil navigates economic challenges and seeks innovative solutions, the growing importance of cryptocurrencies reflects a shift towards more inclusive and resilient financial systems. Zcash could offer several advantages for individuals and businesses in Brazil. One key benefit is enhanced privacy and anonymity features. In a country where concerns about financial privacy are significant, Zcash's technology, which allows for shielded transactions, could appeal to users seeking a more confidential and secure financial experience. Moreover, Zcash's privacy features can contribute to a more fungible and censorship-resistant financial system. In a country with a history of economic volatility and currency devaluation, accessing a cryptocurrency that prioritizes privacy can be valuable for individuals looking to protect their wealth. Additionally, Zcash could serve as a useful tool for businesses engaged in international trade or remittances. The cryptocurrency's borderless nature and relatively faster transaction times compared to traditional banking systems could streamline cross-border transactions, providing an alternative to the often cumbersome and costly international transfer processes. However, it's crucial to note that regulatory considerations, education on the responsible use of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, and addressing any potential misuse concerns would be essential for the successful integration of Zcash or any privacy-centric cryptocurrency into the Brazilian financial landscape.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Who is contributing to this: The Zcash Brazil Team comprises 7 members: @Michae2xl, @Iogy, @Minevg, @vito, @E-zec, @james_katz, @Samaraanni * Brazilian Development Fund: This fund is focused on supporting the development of Zcash-related projects and technology at Brazil/global community levels. It can finance initiatives that advance Zcash’s technical capabilities, scalability, and overall infrastructure. * Brazilian Design Fund: The Design Fund aims to enhance the visual and user experience aspects of Zcash, including wallet interfaces, branding, and educational materials. It focuses on creating a compelling and user-friendly Zcash experience. * Brazilian Operations Fund: The Operations Fund is designed to cover the operational needs of Zcash Brazil. It can support various activities, events, and functions necessary for the smooth operation of Zcash initiatives in the country. Brazilian Development Fund: Having a Zcash Brazilian Development Fund is an excellent opportunity to support the growth and development of the Zcash ecosystem in Brazil and globally. We are interested in utilizing it to support initiatives related to Zcash or blockchain technology, there are several ways you can consider leveraging the fund. Zcash Development Documentation in Portuguese: Creation and maintenance of comprehensive documentation for Zcash development. This resource can serve as a valuable reference for developers looking to work with Zcash. Community Outreach and Awareness: Allocate funds to raise awareness about Zcash and blockchain technology, educating the public and businesses about the benefits and potential use cases. Past Work: During the year 2023, Zcash Brazil, with a contribution from the developer James Katz, created many tools for education and engagement for the Zcash community in Brazil and worldwide. James Katz is an active member of the Brazilian community and in the Zcash forums, with many contributions. He was funded by the minor grants program from the Zcash Foundation and is scheduled to be added as a ZCAP member. Examples of such tools are a few Discord bots we developed. Some of them are: * ZecQuiz * The trivia bot for Discord. It contains a database of questions about Zcash, curated by the Zcash Brasil Team. * ZecGPT * ZecGPT is a bot that integrates OpenAI’s get-4 model for helping all users on Zcash discord servers. The work done isn’t limited to Discord, many other projects were done: * Zcash RPC documentation (https://zcash-rpc.vercel.app/) * This is a website James made to help developers read the Zcashd RPC documentation more easily. * Zcash halving countdown API (https://github.com/james-katz/zcash-halving-countdown) * This is an API that can help developers and websites keep an accurate track of the Zcash blockchain height next halving block and estimated date. * ZecFaucet ([https://zecfaucet.com](https://zecfaucet.com/)) * This was intended as a test, but was a huge success, it’s very popular to introduce Zcash to new people, its main purpose is to onboard new Zcash users. James also received funding from the Zcash Foundation Minor Grants program, mainly to develop a Discord custodial wallet, jokingly called Dizzy (as in DZ – Discord Zcash). This bot was the first discord bot that allowed shielded transactions as deposits and withdrawals. Users can tip each other, play games like Hangman, and earn fractions of ZEC. This is a huge incentive for user engagement and is a huge success. James also developed a zingolib wrapper (https://github.com/james-katz/zingolib-wrapper) that developers can use to integrate zingolib functionality in their code using node.js / javascript. Future Plans: For 2024 we have plans for the development of new ideas, support, and maintenance of the great work we have done so far. All service tools will be supported and maintained during 2024. Some services are costly and require great care to keep running. Also, new ideas are on the horizon, few examples: * LiveZEC (temporary name) * A plugin for OBS and Streamyard that will allow streamers on different platforms to accept $ZEC donations. The donations will accompanied by a message using the memo field. This message will be displayed on the streamer keep screen, and optionally, the plugin will speak the message out loud. We believe this will give ZEC a huge boost in popularity since any streamer will be able to use this tool. * Zcash Vending Machine at events * James’ minor grant also funded the creation of a proof of concept Vending machine that accepts ZEC as payment. We want to showcase this machine at events during 2024, demonstrating and explaining block times, and shielded payments, and introducing users to Zcash. * Electronic games * A popular gadget showcased in presential events is electronic games like a roulette game. We plan to build all sorts of interactive gadgets. We’re also planning to have an independent Developers Fund, to fund and incentivize community members, as such: * Translation * This could be helpful in translating Zcash documentation, translating wallets, and so on… * Documentation * Write documentation about the Zcash libraries and ecosystem, helping new developers find out about Zcash development. Fund * We plan to have a fund of 5000 USD to be available as a bounty developers fund. As expected, developing, hosting, and maintaining these projects aren’t cheap. The main costs are cloud computing hosting and API keys: All discord bots - Costs for hosting the bots roughly add up to $80 ~ USD 100 / month. But we plan to upgrade from Lightsail to a more robust AWS instance. Brazilian Design Fund Having a Zcash Design Development Fund provides a unique opportunity to support and enhance the design aspects of Zcash with visual experiences that facilitate interaction, engagement, and communication between community members. It involves applying design principles to make the community experience more enjoyable, functional, and effective. Zcash Marketing Campaigns on Social Media: Create design materials including banners, posters, and graphics for social media (Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Odisee, Discord, Pod Cast) and marketing campaigns that highlight the advantages of Zcash in terms of privacy and security. Edit audio-visual material created at events. Continuation of the educational campaign with Zoe, an AI-generated avatar chosen by the community. Support international projects such as ZecHub and AFV Club - (report attached) Support at events and meet-ups: Onboard, and network with other privacy-related projects, focused on welcoming new members to the community and new partnerships. Gift Material for Events: Design giveaways to promote Zcash at events. Research new gifts, which would be most efficient for the type of event and price quotes. The objective of the gift is to bring back memories of the brand and the event, build loyalty, engage, and satisfy the recipient. Zcash User Onboarding Tutorials: Create videos, and step-by-step graphical guides for beginners to learn about Zcash addresses, how to set up and use wallets, send transactions, and protect your privacy. Presentation tutorials to ZecHub, ZF AV Club, and the entire ecosystem. Educational Visual Materials: Create educational materials such as infographics, videos, and interactive tutorials to help educate the public in Brazil about the benefits of Zcash and how to use it safely. Privacy Awareness Campaigns: Fund projects to create campaigns that raise awareness about the importance of privacy in financial transactions and how Zcash’s privacy features can benefit users in Brazil. Cryptocurrency Design Workshops: Organize design workshops and training programs in Brazil to empower local designers and developers to create innovative solutions for the cryptocurrency space. Community Involvement: Create simple design tasks for community engagement and involvement with the educational material produced, based on the knowledge passed in the workshops, making it possible to explore the individual talent of each member. Collaborate with designers to create graphics and visual content for community engagement efforts such as community forums, newsletters, and social media groups. Support the community manager in activities that require design pieces. Support the developer with design material for the developed products. Designer Bags: Create design scholarships or grants that allow aspiring designers in Brazil to focus on cryptocurrency-related design projects and research. Redesign of Zcash Global on Discord: Create new room banners to modernize and add those arts to the other language that joined the server. Brazilian Operations Fund: Opportunity to promote and support the growth of Zcash within the country! Community Support and Engagement: Establish and maintain a support network for Zcash users and enthusiasts in Brazil, providing assistance and information about Zcash. Partnerships and Collaborations: Seeking more partnerships as usual. Social Media and Content Creation: Developing a strong online presence through social media channels and content creation. Regularly update websites, blogs, and social media profiles with Zcash-related content. Research and Reports: Commission or fund research studies and reports that explore the potential use cases and impact of Zcash in the Brazilian economy and society. Advocacy and Outreach: Advocate for Zcash within local and national forums, conferences, and discussions about blockchain technology, privacy, and financial innovation in Brazil. Merchant Adoption Programs: Establish incentive programs to encourage businesses in Brazil to accept Zcash as a form of payment, providing them with training and resources for integration. Awareness Campaigns: Launch marketing and awareness campaigns to inform the public about the benefits of Zcash and cryptocurrency usage, focusing on financial privacy and security. Vito is also committed to continuing his work in translation and article writing about Zcash in Portuguese, alongside his video editing tasks. @Vito in particular is tasked with managing Zcash ecosystem relationships for the Brazil team. His duties include arranging meetings and community calls with both Zcash ecosystem participants as well as other outside protocols & teams, both in Portuguese and English, and maintaining collaboration with entities like ZCG, ZF, ECC, and others. Additionally, Vito is responsible for maintaining our Discord server, which involves adding new bots, organizing communities, and fostering growth in Zcash Global. Moreover, Vito’s key objectives include close collaboration with entities such as ZecHub, ZF A/V (led by Ryan Taylor), and the Zcash Foundation (decentralistdan). He will contribute by running social media, producing/editing videos and newsletters, and providing content and workshops in both Portuguese and English. @Vito is also committed to continuing his work in translation and article writing about Zcash in Portuguese, alongside his video editing tasks. Community Involvement: The team will lead in organizing monthly activities and events within the community to ensure the continuous development and growth of Zcash protocol knowledge.
