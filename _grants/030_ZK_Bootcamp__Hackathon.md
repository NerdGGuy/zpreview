- **Detailed Explanation:**
  ZK Bootcamp is a 5-week bootcamp to learn about ZK proof theory and how to use it while building. The course will be completely free, but highly selective. It consists of live Zoom classes (2h, 3 days a week). There will be daily homework and hacking projects to accelerate personal study. We finish it with a Hackathon which we organize during NBX conference in Berlin ( http://nextblockexpo.com/ ). Then we help place graduates in jobs in the blockchain space and protocols access our talent pool.

We help developers enter web3 world. We're building a place where they can get knowledge, meet like-minded people and build first projects together. We organised already three onsite meetups and partnered with web3 gamedev hackathon. This month we'll be hosting workshops with Chainlink Labs. We organised onsite meetups. You can check our meetup group here: https://www.meetup.com/web3-devs-poland/ Website: https://web3devs.pl/ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3-devs-poland/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/web3devspoland YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvV6USxk59dGeCQgxBp61bQ After the grant is completed we will evaluate the results and if the bootcamp ends up sussesfully we will keep organising them with different protocols bringing more devs to web3. We will then hire team members full/part-time (now they work for free). We will also organise hackathons and in the end develop accelerator for devs with entrepreneurial mindset.
- **Recording:**
  Yes
- **Benefit to Zcash:**
  It would increase Zcash exposure and recognition within community interested in ZKP and during the biggest blockchain conference for 5k people. Beside that, this initiative will promote ZKP as there not enough experts and it's slowing down the development of this technology.
- **Other Funding:**
  We have a soft commit from Ethereum Foundation and Polygon for funding a hackathon.
- **Materials Needed:**
  Logo (svg, jpeg), marketing copy that we can put on the materials about what Zcash does.
