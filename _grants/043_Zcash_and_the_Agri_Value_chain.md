- **Benefit to Zcash:**
  The Zcash Blockchain and its potential for Africa is been extensively discussed across the world,The fundamentals of the Zcash blockchain and its use cases will have a significant impact on the African continent if there is first of all a massive awareness creation and education for Farmers within the country to capture the hearts and minds of the Farmers and youth in farming to utilize the potentials this great ecosystem is bringing to our doorstep utilizing both online and face-to-face meetups. For this reason, I am seeking for funding to be able to reach out to 500 farmers in Northern Ghana to educate them about the opportunities Zcash is bringing to the African continent and how they can participate through Zcash Community Grants. This will be achieved through the organization of meetups and conferences where the target audience will extensively be exposed to what Zcash stands for, the things they are already doing around the globe and the benefits it has for Africa as whole. Furthermore as Teacher and a blockchain educator and advocate over the years I have been part of teams that have organized conferences and online meetups to introduce blockchain education to a wider audience on how they can utilize the opportunities associated with this revolutionary technologies. I believe awareness creates a good avenue for adoption and I believe when I get the necessary resources with my team we will be able to spread the awareness, educate farmers about blockchain most especially Zcash like wildfire across the Agricultural value chain in Northern Ghana and possibly beyond utilizing both online and face-to-face education.
