### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The global problem of the DeFi sector, in order to make an exchange, the user needs to use several exchange points, wallets, store intermediate tokens, enter wallets for each exchange point and visit several sites. We solve it all in one click, fully automated with routing of any complexity and gasless technology. This gives growth to the community and especially attracts liquidity. All existing protocols will be able to connect and accept liquidity between different networks and inter-network exchanges, including native coins.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Our task is to create a cross-chain DeFi exchange, when the user does not need to see the bridges, fully automatic with the best rate and speed, so that a user of any level can exchange in one click. Automation allows us to create convenient APIs and SDKs for integration into the B2B sector, where the DeFi exchange will take place at the speed of block confirmation and fully automatic. Any dApp or application can integrate it, and clients can use cross-chain with one click.
- **Solution Format:**
  We can set up advanced routing for your ecosystem by routing existing liquidity and aggregators, also make a cross-chain between networks, including native coins such as BTC, LTC and etc.
- **Dependencies:**
  Works, makes for all members of the Zcash community, we will do it ourselves.
- **Technical approach:**
  We are developing our own bridgeless cross-chain exchange protocol (QXTP) that works as cross-chain exchange through LayerZero proofs and a fallback automated swap protocol (QBP) that aggregates liquidity from a variety of market makers, DEX aggregators, and network bridges.

- **Amount:**
  29998.0

### Budget Breakdown

- **Hardware/Software budget:**
  50000.0
- **Hardware/Software justification:**
  Integration into a smart contract, adding to search routes, setting up bridges and connecting liquidity, gasless technology.
- **Services budget:**
  0.0
- **Services justification:**
  none
- **Compensation budget:**
  0.0
- **Compensation justification:**
  none
- **Startup funding required:**
  Yes
- **Startup funding explanation:**
  Milestone 1: Funding requested upon completion: $15,000 Within two months, we'll complete the work on a smart contract for automation and advanced routing. This is part of the implementation of the QBP protocol, which aggregates liquidity for cross-chain exchange. This stage will be preparation for integration. Milestone 2: Funding requested upon completion: $15,000 Within a month, we will integrate the network into our protocol, adapt smart contracts, conduct audits and tests, fix bugs. Milestone 3: Funding requested upon completion: $10,000 We continue to work on the gasless technology, launch a testnet and debug QBP protocol in live mode. DAO is launching an affiliate program to attract p2p organic traffic and trade turnover. We will integrate DEXes and Bridges, inter-connect the network ecosystem with the many networks we support and sources of liquidity on them. Milestone 4: Funding requested upon completion: $10,000 Finalizing the QBP protocol (automation, routing, gasless technology), fixing all bugs and errors, announcing production release. Providing the SDK to integrate our solution into network projects.

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Qenetex
- **Background:**
  Qenetex is currently a Meta cross-chain DeFi exchange that builds a layer on top of the DEX-aggregators liquidity, bridges, market-makers and bridgeless exchange protocol based on LayerZero proofs.

### Funding History

- **Previous funding:**
  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  We have already integrated Zcash on the binance network, it should not be a problem to expand the network.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  Zcash users will be able to exchange assets between networks in one click in one place.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Growth of trading volume of transactions, new users, new wallets.

### Project Timeline

  3-4 months

### Milestone 1

- **Amount:**
  15000.0
- **Expected Completion Date:**
  10/1/2022

  - **Deliverables:**
    - Within two months, we'll complete the work on a smart contract for automation and advanced routing.
