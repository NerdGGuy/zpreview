- **Project Summary:**
  An official home for the Zcash community at our 1,300 sqft. street-front retail location in downtown Austin, TX!

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Zcash Community Problems to Address No in-real-life Zcash community hub (to our knowledge) Issues gaining significant traction with the mainstream ‘crypto illiterate’ demographic Communicating the importance of transaction privacy (and thus ZEC) to users of other store-of-value protocols Zcash Community x CryptoLearnLab Opportunity Production of educational content emphasizing Zcash’s comparative advantages as a digital store-of-value (i.e unified addresses, zkSNARKs > PLONK, no more trusted set ups in Halo 2)
- **Proposed solution:**
  CryptoLearnLab offers an official home for the Zcash community at our 1,300 sqft. street-front retail location in downtown Austin, TX! We hope to become an official educational provider and event hub for the Zcash Community. 2022 will be a transformative year for the Zcash Protocol. Let's educate and celebrate!
- **Solution Format:**
  Weekly Zcash Educational Seminars In-person introduction of the ‘crypto illiterate’ to the Zcash protocol Stress the importance of transaction privacy in web3 by analyzing web2 pain points Introduce the concepts of unified addresses, viewing keys, encrypted memo field, & PLONK Explore the limitless potential of HAWK & BOLT Monthly Zcash Community Meetups Featured speakers discussing digital privacy / zApp projects Free food & beverage for attendees Provide updates on Zcash protocol development and upgrade release timelines. Root on the Zcash dev team! · Marketing for Zcash Seminars & Community Meetups Feature page on www.cryptolearnlab.com dedicated solely to Zcash and its defining features including seminar / community event calendar Cross-promotion of Zcash events via LEARNcommunity and its community of local business owners. Announcement of partnership at local Austin Bitcoin & Ethereum meetups · Additional Digital Educational Materials for the Zcash Community In-depth CryptoLearnLab research report on Zcash’s defining characteristics and roadmap, emphasizing comparative advantages versus top store-of-value protocols Analysis of Halo Arc & NU5, why this year’s upgrades are a long-term game-changer Analysis and price alerts produced by LEARNelite research team
- **Dependencies:**
  The project depends on CryptoLearnLab maintaining its physical location in Austin, TX for the duration of the project. Additionally, CryptoLearnLab will be responsible for putting on monthly community meetups which the global Zcash community can be proud of, including free food & beverage for attendees. The project is also dependent on the physical and mental well-being of tlogs.eth to deliver educational materials and teach weekly seminars throughout. CryptoLearnLab requests the right to incorporate various Zcash trademarks into the educational materials & reports to be produced. The Zcash Community will have ownership of all educational content produced, which will be free and publicly available to all.
- **Technical approach:**
  Tlogs.eth will first produce the necessary educational material for the weekly seminars and record the presentation for community assessment. Community / foundation feedback will be taken into account and any necessary copy changes will be made. The weekly seminar schedule and monthly event schedules are announced and posted to CryptoLearnLab website Vendors booked for monthly events and promotion at local Austin TX crypto meetups ensues Additional digital marketing via CryptoLearnLab website and socials Physical marketing copy produced and delivered to LEARNcommunity businesses Utilize LEARNtoken giveaways to incentivize attendance, cross-promoting Zcash & LEARNtoken communities Tlogs.eth teaches insightful weekly seminars and CryptoLearnLab puts on beautiful monthly events per schedule Attendance & community feedback are reported back to the digital Zcash Community

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  tlogs.eth
- **Background:**
  Who is tlogs.eth? Tlogs.eth has roughly ten years of corporate finance experience since graduating from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2012. While at UCSB, tlogs was a Teacher’s Assistant in the Accounting Department, teaching weekly discussion sessions of 30 - 50 peers. This is where he discovered his love for teaching. After college, the first five years of his career were spent in big-4 public accounting & regulatory compliance for a securities broker-dealer where he received his CPA and Series-7 designations. Tlogs.eth finally gave cryptocurrency a serious look in late 2015 and hungrily consumed all the information he could find on the few projects in development at that time. After grasping the transformative nature of the Bitcoin protocol as a digital store-of-value, tlogs saw potential issues arising from sensitive financial transactions being recorded to an immutable & public digital ledger. While analyzing ‘privacy coins’ available at the time (ZEC, DASH, & XMR), it became clear Zcash’s implementation of zk-SNARKs at the protocol level made it the clear leader in the space. Tlogs has accumulated ZEC ever since. What is CryptoLearnLab? His most recent five years have been spent leading the finance division at a national bitcoin ATM (BTM) wholesaler & operator. At the beginning of Q2, tlogs found the time right to launch his own educational community to accelerate the adoption of web3 services. CryptoLearnLab combines his passion for blockchain tech & web3 with an ability to communicate key concepts and instill knowledge in students. CryptoLearnLab exists to foster an approachable environment for exploration of web3. We hope to officially promote Zcash during that exploration. In our minds, the Zcash protocol is the optimal digital store-of-value solution for all global capital. With NU5 and Halo 2 upgrades activating, mainstream education is more vital than ever. CryptoLearnLab believes Zcash is on the precipice of significant adoption and wants to do its part to accelerate the movement. We hope to focus our efforts on Zcash education to the mutual benefit of the Zcash community & CryptoLearnLab.

### Funding History

- **Previous funding:**
  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  We assess the most material execution risk to be a lack of attendance at weekly educational seminars and monthly community meetups. Tlogs.eth is a member of multiple crypto meetups which have frequent IRL meetings. We will mitigate the attendance risk by initially promoting the new Zcash partnership throughout the vibrant Austin, TX web3 community. CryptoLearnLab will additionally market the weekly seminars & monthly meetups digitally throughout its LEARNcommunity of Austin business owners. LEARNtoken will be offered as a give away to all event attendees.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  Unintended consequences could include any 'adverse incidents' occurring at an event funded by this project, i.e an injury or destruction of property. Thus professional event staff is costed into the project budget for id-check, security, catering, and beverage services to ensure all risks are minimized. Additionally, CryptoLearnLab maintains business liability insurance to mitigate financial risks from adverse incidents. CryptoLearnLab requests the Zcash Community review all educational materials for completeness and accuracy to mitigate the risk of incorrect or outdated information being communicated to the public. All relevant disclaimers regarding financial advise will be included in the educational material.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Quantitative Metrics Weekly Educational Seminars Cumulative Attendance Week-Week Attendance with Historical Chart Monthly Meetups Cumulative Attendance Month-Month Attendance with Historical Chart Number of Privacy Speakers Hosted Educational Materials Number of Research Reports Produced Number of Price Alerts Released Qualitative Metrics Feed-back from crypto-illiterate posted to forum (student write-ups incentivized via LEARN giveaways) Write-ups of monthly meetups including photographs and community quotes posted to forum.

### Project Timeline

- **Project timeline determination:**
  For max value, we believe the first meetup should be held during Consensus 2022 which is coming to Austin this June. Thus the rapid kickoff. Also we would be perfectly-positioned to promote the activation of NU5 and Halo 2 system. Otherwise six-months seems a reasonable trial-period for a first grant. CryptoLearnLab hopes to renew this partnership in perpetuity.
