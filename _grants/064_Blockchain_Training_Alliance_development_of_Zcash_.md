- **Project Summary:**
  To create a professionally produced video series of educational and training courses to introduce developers to the Zcash ecosystem.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Zcash does not have a formal series of educational programs to both introduce the ecosystem to new developers and clearly define growth opportunities for prospective developers.
- **Proposed solution:**
  BTA will develop and produce a Zcash-specific training course which will be available at no cost on the BTA website for any interested students to enroll. This training project will include curriculum design/layout and question/exam formatting. BTA is hosting the training course on their current Learning Management System. The class is on demand and students will have access for one year, starting immediately on the day of enrollment. On demand training is designed for those who prefer to develop the skills they need on their time and at their own pace. Students can stop, pause, rewind, and revisit the videos and labs provided in the class as needed. Through the internal BTA Learning platform students have a support rep to handle all student issues and questions when taking the course. This is done through an already developed ticketing systems; tickets are responded to within 24 hours.
- **Solution Format:**
  Educational videos hosted on www.blockchaintrainingalliance.com that can be shared across the Zcash community.
- **Dependencies:**
  BTA is a self-contained education company that creates and produces all educational content in-house. We do encourage input from the Zcash team, if they would like to be included. Zcash will own all rights to reproduce and share the content that BTA creates.
- **Technical approach:**
  BTA will complete all post-production editing & rendering to create a high-quality production videos that’ll be viewed by thousands of prospective Zcash developers. Students are able to access details about the course via the Blockchain Training Alliance website. The link includes the following on the page: Short preview video covering what students will learn in the course Course Overview Course Prerequisites Course Outline and Topic FAQs on the course Once the student orders the class, the student is provided access via the BTA Learning Management System. Access is available to the student for one year.

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Blockchain Training Alliance
- **Background:**
  BTA has been developing, filming and producing training on Blockchain and Web3 since 2017. Our training programs include non-technical courses and technical training on topics like, Blockchain Security, Solidity and others. BTA has trained more than 100,000 students and provides certifications in Blockchain that are recognized around the world. All filming and production is done in-house and production is done in a manner to ensure students are able to easily understand the content and practice their learning with a series of comprehensive labs.

### Funding History

  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  From our experience since 2017, we have found that the greatest barrier to an educational course's success is lack of promotion from the community. BTA creates courses that are meant to be shared and are able to be consumed and learned at the student's individual learning pace.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  BTA will avoid this type of issue by working closely with the Zcash team to protect and guard all proprietary information and processes. The BTA system was created to handle large volumes of online students and has built-in redundancies to guarantee a seamless learning experience.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  BTA is focused on ensuring that developers in the Web3 space are aware of the opportunity to take this free training. Our success will be based on student enrollment, and we would like to see 5,000 students enrolled in the course by end of 2023. BTA will deliver enrollment, progress, and completion metrics monthly to Zcash. BTA will also provide survey results from students that have successfully completed the course.
