- **Project Summary:**
  Leverage our 70+ global chapters to spread awareness about Zcash and the importance of privacy in general.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Most people do not understand the importance of privacy and how Zcash can be used to improve their own privacy.
- **Proposed solution:**
  The CryptoMondays (CM) DAO is a coordination and support mechanism for the people who are hosting CM meetups in every city. By creating a framework and resources for CM event organizers, the DAO will make the creation and hosting of events easier, facilitating community growth around the world. As we continue to onboard new users to Web3, we can make sure to give them an understanding of why privacy matters while highlighting the critical role that Zcash is playing in improving everyone's privacy. Through this way, we would aim to spread awareness among new potential retail ZEC holders. Some examples of how the DAO can facilitate meetups includes sharing visual/marketing assets, content collection and distribution, marketing and social media management, community management, education resources, and event planning. When the DAO is properly organized around the world, Members (volunteers) and partners (sponsors and service providers/event hosts) benefit from the access and visibility across the global CryptoMondays network, which already consists of 30k+ members in 60+ cities around the world. It is because of our DAO structure that we can provide grassroots local access on a global scale.
- **Solution Format:**
  We can give greater exposure of Zcash and the importance of privacy to our community. Essentially in any city that we have a CryptoMondays meetup, we offer exposure and community on-demand.
- **Dependencies:**
  We have no external dependencies
- **Technical approach:**
  Not applicable
