- **Project Summary:**
  ZURE will study ZEC usage among early adopters to drive engagement and inform tech development. The goal is increasing Zcash adoption.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The problem ZURE aims to solve is the lack of exclusive focus on Zcash Product users, i.e. users of the private payment system. User-focused information and updates are scattered and mixed in with information about Zcash Technology. See Intro to ZURE for more info.
- **Proposed solution:**
  ZURE‚Äôs solution to the problem is methodical collection, analysis, reporting, and public discussion of Zcash Product user feedback, where ‚ÄúZcash Product‚Äù is defined as the private payment system. The goal is to engage early adopters of Zcash, focus the conversation on ZEC usage, normalize the idea of using ZEC for payments, develop a community of private payment users, inform ecosystem developments that support ZEC usage through public reports and discussion that involves both, users and builders, and keep the Zcash community updated on usage-related developments, issues, and opportunities. Zcashers, interested in learning more about using ZEC for payments, are ZURE's target audience. They are invited to participate in User Interviews. ZURE's stakeholders include Zcash enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and builders, interested in leveraging usage insights and increasing user adoption. They will be engaged through public discussion and, when necessary, 1:1 calls and small group meetings.
- **Solution Format:**
  ZURE‚Äôs vision is to build a user adoption engine, with user research at its core. There are multiple deliverables in this process. Short-term deliverables include, but are not limited to public UR Reports, public discussions of usage insights, and a @UseZcash twitter account, dedicated to usage-focused updates and developments. Long-term deliverables include user-focused content, usez.cash website, closed UR participant channels (TG, Signal), events, and more.
- **Dependencies:**
  ZURE is impossible without willing participants. Its success depends on the ecosystem‚Äôs willingness to support and participate in this process. End users: Interview and survey participation Public discussion participation Note: My estimates for this grant rely on past results. For example: The majority of 1st Round user interviews, completed at ECC, took about 3-4 weeks to complete. Builders, organizations, supporters: Public discussion participation Support and collaboration: Forms of support from builders and leaders may include feature updates, answering common questions, contributing to the resolution of common user issues, and etc. Examples: ECC‚Äôs readiness to support ZURE‚Äôs comms by collaborating on community outreach (shoutout to Nate and Chris T. üôÇ) Collaborating with ambassadors on things like survey translation and distribution
- **Technical approach:**
  User Interviews, Round 1/Wave 2 Expand the 1st round of user interviews, and add to the 62 interviews completed at ECC. (see attached report) My calendar will be available to anyone who wants to participate Zcash Usability Testing Conduct a full review of the ecosystem from a ZEC user perspective Test all standard ZEC actions available on recommended exchanges (buying, sending, receiving, storing, z- vs t- vs u-) Test all standard ZEC actions available on recommended wallets (seed phrase import, memos, transactions, etc) Test recommended ways of using Zcash Product (earn, donate, pay - Giving Block, Spedn, Free2Z, ZecHub, PayWithZcash, etc) Survey and interview design Use this information, along with 1st Round insights, to design the 2nd Round of interviews. Use the results from user surveys ran at ECC, along with the ecosystem review insights to design a survey (one or more). The sequence will be decided during the analysis. User Interviews, Round 2 Complete the 2nd round of Interviews Public Discussion Publishing the most interesting highlights throughout the process Create and publish a complete report once the 2nd wave of Round 1 and the 1st wave of 2nd Round interviews are complete. Invite the Zcash community to discuss the results on various platforms, such as Zcash Forum, @UseZcash Twitter, Discord, and other. Make additions and/or adjustments to the public report based on the public feedback analysis Next steps Use interview results and public feedback to design the next steps New rounds of interviews New surveys User-focused content and updates Group discussions and online events Publish the next steps and begin the process all over again

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Tatyana
- **Background:**
  Former Head of Product Marketing at Electric Coin Company. 8 years of product marketing, 7 years of content management and strategy, 15 years of copywriting, 15 years of startup marketing. While still with ECC, I launched the 1st round of User Research (UR) interviews (see Zcash User Research, Round 1/Wave 1 ). It consisted of 62 interviews and was designed to gather Zcash user sentiment and build relationships (see . I also conducted an extensive analysis of crypto adoption around the world and ran several surveys. My plan for ZURE takes the findings of those efforts into account.

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The majority of the risk stems from the dependencies. As I mentioned above, a lack of participation is the biggest threat to this project. There is also a risk of skewed results, if the effort doesn‚Äôt reach a wide enough audience of Zcash users. This is why it‚Äôs important not to favor any particular comms channel and to continue to seek out and welcome new participants. Because this effort targets active early adopters, those who choose to join and stick with this process are ZURE‚Äôs target audience by default. These early adopters are the key to wider Zcash Product adoption.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  I honestly can‚Äôt think of any.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Survey results User interview results and observations Zcash Product usability testing results and observations Public reports and public discussion summaries Ongoing user-focused, UR-driven updates and content Overall level of community engagement and collaboration with ZURE

### Project Timeline

- **Project timeline determination:**
  Note: Each week represents approximately 40 hours of work. Due to dependencies mentioned above and the fluid nature of ZURE's process, the actual hours per week could vary. It is also important to note that December tends to be a slow month due to holidays, which may affect the time it takes to complete Phase 1. Deliverables include, but are not limited to the following: User Interviews, Round 1/Wave 2 Week 1: Launch R1/W2 Week 1-4: Community survey Week 5: Public report Week 1-5: ongoing updates to forum, X @UseZcash, and other relevant channels Zcash Usability Testing Week 1: begin full review of the ecosystem from a ZEC user perspective Week 2: Round 2 design Week 5: Public report Week 1-5: ongoing updates to forum, X @UseZcash, and other relevant channels User Interviews, Round 2/Wave 1 Week 3: Launch R2/W1 - invite Round 1 participants Week 3-7: Community Survey Week 9: Public Report Week 3-9: ongoing updates to forum, X @UseZcash, and other relevant channels Public Discussion Week 1-8: Ongoing public updates Week 1-8: Public reports for Usability Testing, Round 1, and Round 2 Week 9: Phase 1 of ZURE is complete Week 10: Master public report, analyzing Phase 1 of ZURE Content Week 1-10: begin to create and organize content for the usez.cash website Next steps Week 10: Phase 2 proposal. Possible steps include: Expanding Rounds 1 and 2 Adding Round 3, focusing on competitor analysis New surveys User-focused content and updates Group discussions and online events
