- **Project Summary:**
  This proposal seeks to grow Zcash‚Äôs open-source education hub and onboard more contributors to Zcash.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  ZecHub provides an open source platform where community members can work together on creating and promoting educational content that supports the Zcash ecosystem.
- **Proposed solution:**
  ZecHub provides easy to understand education resources, primarily through the wiki site. We also create video tutorials, animated explainers of Zcash, podcast episodes and a weekly Zcash ecosystem newsletter.
  
  Anyone can review our documentation for accuracy, create new content and use the hub‚Äôs structure to facilitate new ideas that benefit the hub‚Äôs education stack and the Zcash ecosystem. This process has incentivized community members to become more active contributors to Zcash and adjacent crypto ecosystem communities to come in and eventually contribute to the protocol.
  
  ZecHub rewards every contribution by distributing ZEC from a pool of funds that is overseen by the DAO. We focus on advancing Zcash education and provide a uniform and easy process for people to earn ZEC.
- **Solution Format:**
  Zcash & Privacy Technology Wiki site
  Zcash Ecosystem Weekly Newsletter
  Consistent Zcash education for Crypto ùïè/Twitter
  Animations, Video Tutorials, Podcasts and other media
  Wallet tutorials, User guides
  X spaces / Community events / Workshops
  Media about other privacy projects (i.e. Namada). Trial of Retroactive Compensation for Global Ambassadors Support efforts towards My First Zcash v2 Some of our recent work:
   Zcash Orchard Thread 
   Zcash Shielded Assets Video ZecHub Podcast with Kurt Opsahl Zcash Shielded Supply Charts
- **Dependencies:**
  Availability of FPF operational support will be necessary for the bounty program. 
  
  The podcast and twitter spaces events are dependent on Zcash community members and other projects being open to attending. 
  
  ZecHub is dependent on its DAO members and open-source contributors to create & vote on governance proposals.
- **Technical approach:**
  Starting June 2024:
  
  Creation of new Zcash & Privacy Ecosystem documentation / network metrics 
  Bi-weekly Sync Meetings with Discord community + DAO members
  ZecWeekly Ecosystem Newsletter 
  Work with Design SubDAO on Zcash Projects 
  Trial a retroactive compensation program for Global Ambassadors 
  Everyone is free to use our materials to support their own channels. 
  
  A separate grant will be submitted by FPF for the bounty program. We are partnering with FPF who will administer the ZecHub bounty program. ZecHub will retain ownership of the bounty program, its strategic direction, and decisions regarding bounty recipients. FPF will handle only the administration of program payouts and the associated due diligence and accounting activities. This partnership with FPF will strengthen both ZecHub and the bounty program, ultimately benefiting the Zcash community
