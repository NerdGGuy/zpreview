- **Project Summary:**
  TOOKEY - asset and access management protocol that intends to transform the enterprise private key management paradigm across Web3.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The problem scope is massive: more than $500 million was stolen from only 4 protocols in December 2021 due to a compromised secret key issue. Cross-chain bridges remain a major target for hackers, with 3 bridges breached this month (October 2022) and nearly $600 million stolen. (Chainalysis) Current private key administration experience is absolutely off: Management of access is the complex and unhandled issue of many Web3 projects. Automation of execution requires disclosure of private keys inside a semi-trusted environment, driving weak security. Access control on smart contracts is limited by on-chain data and brings additional complexity and execution costs
- **Proposed solution:**
  We building TOOKEY - asset and access management protocol that intends to transform the enterprise private key management paradigm across Web3, DeFi, and Collectible platforms. Tookey identifies threats of private key compromise and fraudulent transaction pushing, letting developers integrate and deploy it quickly. This is now possible due to the implementation of Threshold signature schemes. TSS allows several people to sign transactions using a single public key. Pluggable Tookey's core components are the TSS participation library and the Key Service API. These components enable the development of third-party applications such as DeFi protocol maintenance tools, end-user wallets, CEX depositaries, escrow services, and so on.
- **Solution Format:**
  Milestone ​​1 - Zcash Network integration into Tookey Signer (Signer - mobile application for generating a distributed key and generating a signature) Milestone 2 - Creation of a library for developers that enables the use of Tookey in project management.
- **Dependencies:**
  The finest assistance will be technological implementation guidance, so we can produce the best solution for the team while providing the most value to ecosystem patrons. Tookey team currently passing the process of incorporation in the UAE
- **Technical approach:**
  We suspect the issue is identified in three aspects: Proper security against compromise of the private key severely restricts projects and reveals numerous business operations unfeasible. Standard approaches usually provide a low level of security. At their own risk, most projects distribute keys to high-ranking managers for sole control, which can lead to loss of funds or private key compromisation. Multisig is a terrific approach to boost security, but the complexity of gathering those signatures and the algorithms for interacting with multisig keys cause challenges and limitations that most projects and users cannot tolerate. In our opinion, three characteristics must be included in a management solution: Allow third-party access to the wallet (partners, staff, and even servers), but explicitly limit the potential modes of engagement. Compatible with various execution contexts and should not be firmly bound to a certain blockchain or wallet. The solution must be non-custodial; the risk of compromise of control as a result of an unethical service provider is too terrific. We solved the problem by meeting all three requirements, now keys can be exchanged with Tookey and are no longer secret, but remain secure and protected. By making private keys divisible, sharable, and pluggable, we reframed the concept of private key access and security, also ensures that a single key can be utilized in multiple scenarios.

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Tookey
- **Background:**
  The Tookey team has already collaborated on the creation of cutting-edge solutions such as cross-chain bridges, crypto wallets, aggregation, and lending protocols. We chose to utilize accumulated knowledge for the construction of non-custodial web3 solution for organizations due to the increased number of cyber security concerns. Core Team: Aler Denisov, CTO & Founder - 11+ years of experience in tech management and development. Projects: gp7.app - TSS crypto wallet; oxygen.org - lending protocol in Solana; Blockchain consultant for Accenture, Deloitte, Lecture at Binary District and Cryptocademy. https://www.linkedin.com/in/aler-denisov-43967647/ GitHub: https://github.com/alerdenisov Vasily Shilov, Managing Partner & Founder - 3+ years experience in DeFi Project Management and Business Development Projects: Nimbus.io - DAO-governed ecosystem, eywa.fi - crosschain data & liquidity protocol, WOWSwap - Lending protocol, WoWMAX - DEX aggregation protocol https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasily-shilov-520651201/ Nik Krasnoperov, Chief Marketing Officer, 15 + years in PR, before Tookey, Nik was Lead PR at 1Inch. https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitaredfeather/ Tookey team is remote, located in Spain, Thailand, and Ukraine

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The team encountered various challenges while working on this project, including the requirement that MVP fulfill all existing asset management and protection criteria, be simple to implement in any given protocol, and be cost-effective. The technology is already there; the major problem for the Tookey team is to create and frame a new-era Web3 cyber security solution within a limited budget. By connecting more protocols, we will be able to adapt Tookey to a broader variety of demands while mastering functionality and introducing new from-the-box capabilities for enterprise clients such as DAO and escrow setup administration.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  The fundamental problem remains to maintain a reliable and decentralized system that developers may deploy in any given protocol or execution context. Owing to limited resources, the development of EDSA and EDDCA signature types and hardhat plugin integrations may take longer due to interoperability concerns. Also, we anticipate that there may be various challenges with user flows, glitches, and so forth during the early stages of development, but we are prepared for this. Such events will help us to identify system flaws and design and supply amazing solutions for the web3 sector.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  The number of protocol integrations by organizations and the total amount of protocol money safeguarded will be used to determine success. In the near future, our team will strive to lower the overall volume of crypto thefts linked with compromised private keys; this, we believe, will be the most fulfilling moment. Furthermore, the maintenance of distributed private key infrastructure necessitates a high level of expertise in order to provide robust and safe solutions; when it comes to business security, we cannot afford to fail.
