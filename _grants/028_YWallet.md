- **Project Summary:**
  Fast Shielded Wallet

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Part of the grant is retroactive and applies to YWallet. It took over a year of development to reach its current state. Following on Zooko idea of offering grants for projects that have delivered value to the Zcash ecosystem, I apply for YWallet to receive the first grant of this kind. Due to increased transaction volume and high block occupancy, most wallets have considerable difficulty in maintaining their operation. Thanks to Warp Sync, YWallet was quite successful in keeping up with the new workload.
- **Proposed solution:**
  YWallet is released and available for download on Google and Apple Stores. There are also versions for desktop computers.
- **Solution Format:**
  The Ywallet app and documentation web site. YWallet is published under my account on iOS and Android.
- **Dependencies:**
  There are no dependencies.
- **Technical approach:**
  YWallet has a website: https://ywallet.app

### Requested Grant Amount

- **Amount:**
  350000.0

### Budget Breakdown

- **Hardware/Software budget:**
  350000.0
- **Hardware/Software justification:**
  Other Zcash shielded wallets have already received grants totalling ~500k each. YWallet has demonstrated that its performance, stability and features are top notch and deserves similar funding. - During the CZ NFT offering, YWallet delivered every subscription without fail, - YWallet was the first (and for a while, the only wallet) to work after NU-5 - YWallet could handle the increased work load affecting Zcash since Jul 2022. All other wallets ceased to work at some point. - YWallet has extensive documentation and videos for all its major features, including tutorial videos. YWallet app: 300 000 $ Documentation and tech support: 50 000 $
