- **Project Summary:**
  Build and host a secure, user-friendly Zcash wallet inside Discord and develop Node.js libraries for Zcash interaction.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The opportunity: Discord has established itself as the leading platform for community building, offering customization through its support for Discord Bots. I propose the creation of a wallet that runs directly on Discord, eliminating the need for separate
  installations or synchronization issues. With a Discord account, users will now have access to a
  fully functional Zcash wallet, capable of sending and receiving shielded ZEC in a matter of
  seconds. This discord wallet presents numerous opportunities for community engagement, such as the ability
  to send tips, participate in airdrops, and other community-driven activities. Dubbed “Dizzy Wallet”
  or “DZ Wallet” (acronym for Discord Zec Wallet), it is set to be the easier way for new users start
  using Zcash. To further promote the development of Zcash-ready applications, a Node.js library based on
   @adityapk00 ’s zecwallet-cli is also being developed. This library will be released as open-source,
  enabling developers to build and integrate Zcash-powered applications using Javascript. The problem: The adoption of cryptocurrencies has been hindered by a number of factors, including the
  reluctance of new users to download a full-fledged wallet and general skepticism towards digital
  currencies. Dizzy Wallet addresses these concerns by automatically creating a wallet for the user, enabling them
  to receive tips, send, and deposit ZEC with ease. While there is already a bot called tip.cc, that serves a similar purpose, its unreliability and
  downtime have resulted in the postponement of important events. With full-time dedication to
  programming, maintenance, and debugging the code, Dizzy Wallet will ensure seamless and
  uninterrupted usage of ZEC on Discord for the entire community. Dizzy Wallet is exclusively focused on Zcash, making its usage and interface more user-friendly.
  Outgoing transactions is shielded by default. Dizzy Wallet is versatile and can be added to an unlimited number of servers, providing a seamless
  and user-friendly experience for a growing number of users. The Dizzy Wallet will be available for public use, allowing integration into a variety of servers,
  including those focused on Zcash, cryptocurrency in general, gaming, and so on… This will provide a
  platform for individuals to learn and utilize Zcash. After first contact with Zcash through Dizzy Wallet, users will be encouraged to try traditional wallets, such as ZecWallet, YWallet, Zingo!, and so on … Just to reiterate, Dizzy Wallet is not meant to be an alternative or replacement for traditional wallets. It's purpose is for introducing new users to Zcash.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Dizzy Wallet is a Discord bot that provides seamless and secure access to Zcash transactions. The
  bot will be hosted on a secure cloud computing platform to ensure the highest level of security and
  reliability. Developing, testing, and deploying such software requires a significant amount of resources and
  expertise. I hope to be eligible for this grant from Zcash Foundation to cover the costs associated
  with development, debugging, and maintenance of Dizzy Wallet. Dizzy Wallet provides an easy and convenient way for new users to enter the world of Zcash,
  without the need for downloading, installing, and synchronizing a full-fledged wallet. This opens up
  new opportunities for Zcash adoption and helps to attract a larger user base. Dizzy Wallet enables various community-driven activities on Discord servers, including: Normal Zcash transactions (Transparent and Shielded) – providing full access to ZEC
  transactions. Direct tips – allowing users to send ZEC to other users Airdrops – encouraging users to join and split rewards Active tips – Tipping active users in a channel Phrase drops – rewarding users who participate by typing a specific phrase.
- **Solution Format:**
  The proposed work will consist of the following steps: Development, maintenance and hosting of the Dizzy Wallet on a secure cloud computing
  platform. Support of the Zcash Latam Team in promoting Zcash on Discord and engaging users. Maintenance and hosting of other Discord bots created for Zcash Latam, such as ZecQuiz
  and ZecStats. Development and procurement of hardware to create a proof-of-concept Zcash Snack
  Machine, to be showcased at in-person events. Availability to assist the Zcash Latam Team in executing any other projects they might
  undertake.
- **Dependencies:**
  The hosting of the services will depend on Virtual Cloud Computing services and the proposed solution is to use Amazon AWS for hosting all services. But there are other good VPS that could be considered.
- **Technical approach:**
  Starting in February / March 2023: Continuation of previous works: Maintaining and hosting ZecStats Maintaining and hosting ZecQuiz Completion of Node.js libraries for interaction with Zcash Ongoing development of Dizzy Wallet, the Discord-based Zcash wallet Continued work as a content creator and 3D animator, creating additional animations for
  Zcash. Start the construction of a proof of concept Zcash Snack Machine. Providing assistance and support to the Zcash community in any way possible.

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The execution risks for the Dizzy Wallet project seem to be limited. For this particular project, Dizzy Wallet is a hot wallet. If I receive the grant, I’ll be following
  Brazil’s Cryptocurrency legislation to ensure users safety and privacy. The use of a popular and secure cloud computing provider, such as Amazon AWS, should help
  mitigate any security concerns. There is no unkown factors that could jeopardize success, since de demand for this kind of service
  already exists.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  In the case of Dizzy Wallet, it is important to note that user funds will be centralized in a database, which may pose some security concerns. However, it is important to keep in mind that the project is not intended to be a full-featured wallet, but rather a simple introduction to Zcash for new users. To mitigate security concerns, we plan to use reputable VPC services such as AWS, which offer features like encryption and firewalls to enhance security. Additionally, we plan to encourage users to transfer their funds to a proper wallet as soon as possible and learn more about Zcash in the process. We will strongly encourage users to avoid storing significant amounts of ZEC in Dizzy Wallet to minimize the potential risks associated with holding cryptocurrency in a hot wallet. Other than that, I don't see any other negative ramifications of the project's success.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  For this project the metrics I will provide is: Code development status using GitHub; Twice a month report on features implementation and users satisfaction. Number of active users / number of discord servers.
