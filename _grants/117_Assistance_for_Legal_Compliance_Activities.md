### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  We are in the later stages of the development of the software that provides Zcash Shielded Assets to the Zcash protocol. There has been increased scrutiny of authorities on cryptocurrencies and private blockchains in the recent past. Therefore our activities related to the legal and compliance aspects of this work have increased. This grant is for assistance with respect to increased company costs to comply with relevant regulations.
- **Proposed solution:**
  The grant funds will be used for work with experienced blockchain and cryptocurrency legal team - to help QEDUT review the technical work of the ZSA protocol, assess how current and potential future regulations may apply, and provide legal guidance. We will provide them with detailed technical information on the work in question and work closely with them to ensure their legal analysis is well-informed by an accurate understanding of the underlying technology.
- **Solution Format:**
  We will submit the relevant invoices to the Zcash Foundation, primarily in for legal consultations and compliance related activities.
- **Dependencies:**
  N/A
- **Technical approach:**
  No real technical details, as this is grant proposal covers a need for funds for legal consultations and compliance activities.

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  QEDIT
- **Background:**
  We are  QEDIT , the cryptography team that has been working on the Zcash Shielded Assets (ZSA) and Asset Swaps capabilities. Previously we performed the audits for both  Sapling  and  Orchard  before they launched into main-net. We are a significant part of the  ZKProof.org standardization effort , and we have led the  zkInterface interoperability standard  within the DARPA-funded  SIEVE program  to advance the state-of-the-art of ZKPs.

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  Even with expert legal opinions, the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies remains uncertain and subject to change, especially in the long-term. The legal guidance will be based on the current state of the law. Changes in applicable laws and regulations could potentially impact the long-term viability and compliance of the work. While not eliminated, this risk can be mitigated by working with up-to-date legal experts who can help anticipate potential future developments in the legal and regulatory environment.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  The legal analysis could surface issues that may require changes to the software we deliver, leading to adjustments regarding current scope of work and associated budgets, to accommodate for the development of those changes. However we believe there is a clear benefit in proactively identifying and addressing legal risks, in advance of realizing the risks.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  We will submit invoices to the Zcash Foundation, for amounts not exceeding $100,000 for the year 2024.
