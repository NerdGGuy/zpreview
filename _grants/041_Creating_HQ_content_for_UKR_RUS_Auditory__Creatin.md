### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Ukrainians say - that the police are the face of the country. I agree with it . Same here - community members are the face of Zcash Foundation. So our team will do everything to create this “face”. We want create high quality content on youtube to help newcomers understand this project. Because new members don't know where to start learning about Zcash . They haven't quality source for this. Also we want show them news about project. In tg channel we want to create family. I want to show them that they are valued here. You know - if you give a person a sense of importance, he will be with you without money. Because on bearish market we see big problem - a lot of peoples joining to project only for earning rewards, not for idea, they not interesting on it. We here to solve it.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Our team aim on potential Zcash community participants. With HQ content and quality communication in tg we can educate newcomers and stir up the interest of current members
- **Solution Format:**
  Youtube and telegram channel
- **Dependencies:**
  We need support on start from ZF Discord and other social networks
- **Technical approach:**
  After creating tg channel we'll post 3-5 new articles, after that we will buy advertising in popular tier 2-3 influencers in our country to engage new auditory. We will answer on all questions of newcomers . After 2 week since launch tg channel - we create youtube channel and will send tg audience to youtube to introducing more about project. Of course we prepare a few videos before launching. The best way to create strong community is support project participants and chew new information for like a six year old child:)
