### Event Details

- **Event Name:**
  N3THACK
- **Event Category:**
  Hackathon
- **Event Location:**
  Helsinki, Finland
- **Event Date:**
  5/26/2023
- **Target Audience:**
  We are the Nordic project, participants from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Estonia will attend. Our community consists of developers, web3 enthusiasts, C-level management and founders. All in web3 field.
- **Detailed Explanation:**
  Web3 Builders is the biggest web3 event organizer in Finland. We onboard people and companies from web2 to web3 and provide education and recruitment support. Our ever-growing community (mainly consisting of developers, web3 start- up founders and web3 enthusiasts) is hungry to apply their knowledge to the growing web3 space. Now we are putting together the N3THACK: N3thack is a hackathon, wrapped in a conference format. We aim to welcome over 500 people for two days of talks, panels, workshops, networking and, of course, building. We will connect developers, founders and entrepreneurs, blockchain enthusiasts and everyone else interested in the emerging world of web3. Talks will feature great speakers from all over the world discussing the most important topics of web3: the future of cryptocurrencies, DeFi, social media in web3, crypto regulations, NFTs, practical applications of web3 in real life, the Metaverse and much more. Learn from the best. Workshops will dive right into practicalities, allowing participants to upgrade their programming, digital art, or NFT skills. The Hackathon will gather around 30-40 teams to compete for a prize pool of 100,000 USD. We have identified the following goals: 1.Gather together 500+ web3 enthusiasts Around 2/3 of n3thack visitors are planned to be conference visitors. Then 100 - 200 hackathon participants will be mainly reached by involving an already existing community of Finland, as well as communities from nearby countries like Sweden, Norway, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. We will also reach out to the rest of Europe, especially UK, Turkey, Portugal, France and Germany - where the web3 community is concentrated the most. However, participants from any country or region are welcome to join. 2.Strengthen the community by creating a true web3 hub in Nordics. For over half a year Web3 Builders' main goal was to create a Nordic community. It is moving extremely fast and with n3thack we plan to accelerate it even further. N3thackâ€™s community is there to support web3 builders with whatever is needed, from networking and fundraising to talent acquisition and legal help. 3.Welcome at least 100 women Web3 Builders co-founders are female. We understand how important it is to include women in the next technological era and support them on each step of the way. That is the reason women's tickets will be offered at a lower rate. 4.Recruit a minimum of 25% hackathon participants A Hackathon is a great way to meet people and practice your skills. However, we want it to have a long-lasting effect. Hence, we will create a pool of hackathon participants with their CVs and will assist in matching them with web3 companies looking to hire talent.
