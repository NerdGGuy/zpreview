- **Project Summary:**
  We solved basic Web 3 infrastructure issues, such as large-scale internet access. For this we form private and governmental partnerships.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Mass adoption of Web 3 will only be possible if it solves the problems of Web 1 and 2. The biggest challenge is to allow access to those who still do not have an internet connection, 37% of the world's population! Without this inclusion, technologies will not reach billions of users or those most in need of technological innovations.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Trying to solve this problem individually will be the same as solving the economic problem that precedes it, so the most appropriate way is the collective solution. We have developed an economic and social solution to allow internet access in public locations, for this we have partnered with private and government companies. Our first partner city is the city of São Paulo, the 21st largest economy in the world, even though Brazil is the richest country in Latin America, the reality of most of the Brazilian population is different, those who can access the internet use prepaid services or with limited data, which makes the use of most Web products unfeasible 3. Our partnership with the City and State of São Paulo can integrate other collaborations such as Zcash tax payments, collaborations between the city and the Zcash Foundation on smart city projects and others.
- **Solution Format:**
  We are delivering a solution to the internet's biggest infrastructure problem, with scalability of use for millions of people. We work in collaboration with various parties for our core "Free WiFi" program, acting through Continent DAO as the management center for this initiative.
- **Dependencies:**
  Each participant and partner is of great importance, such as private companies that provide telecommunications services, to municipalities that offer us these public locations and we invest and tokenize these programs with partners. Good performance of these 3 components is required.
- **Technical approach:**
  Our tokennomics is voting weight, using NFTs to identify geographic locations of hotspots and their owners. Our traditional approach to teaching new users is through use and play, unlike the traditional industry approach that first explains how bitcoin works, smart conrracs, and others with a lot of theory and little practice.

### Requested Grant Amount

- **Amount:**
  50000.0

### Budget Breakdown

- **Hardware/Software budget:**
  0.0
- **Hardware/Software justification:**
  All hardware, software and maintenance costs are already included in the contracting of services with private companies (Telecom).
- **Services budget:**
  500000.0
- **Services justification:**
  Government contracts have a minimum duration of 5 years, the cost of 1 hotspot is 100K per year, so we calculate the total cost of 500,000 USD over 5 years.
- **Compensation budget:**
  500000.0
- **Compensation justification:**
  All hardware, software and maintenance costs are already included in the contracting of services with private companies (Telecom). Electricity costs are borne by the City of São Paulo. Government contracts have a minimum duration of 5 years, the average cost with 1 hotspot is 100K per year, so we calculate the total cost of 500,000 USD over 5 years. We may receive this amount in tranches if necessary, but the 5-year contractual commitment must be maintained.
- **Startup funding required:**
  Yes
- **Startup funding explanation:**
  We encourage our partners to also make contributions to fund the daily operations of Continent DAO. We have an operating cost with accounting, lawyers and marketing for partnerships and contributions.
- **Startup funding amount:**
  50000.0
- **Total proposed grant value:**
  150000.0

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The main challenge for us is to educate the crypto industry that today has enough technology and money to make changes, it is difficult for a community that lives technology daily to understand that a large part of the world does not have access to the internet or when it has this access there is a limit of data to use. Another challenge is that many crypto companies have adopted traditional investment models and processes and our professional experience comes from Web 3. I think that people ignoring the unresolved problems of Web 1 and 2 is what can most compromise the mass adoption of Web 3.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  Education will be a big challenge because our audience is new users, we will have access to millions of people and we will need to educate them properly. The technical part is the least challenging because we will be integrating services that have been tested and used for decades and our partners are committed to maintenance and service.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Our commitment to transparency is standard for all our activities. Quantitative Metrics: Customer churn rate, Customer lifetime value (LTV), Customer retention cost. Qualitative Metrics: Customer Feedback and Customer Satisfaction And other metrics required in government contracts.
