### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Zcash is one of the solid blockchain protocol in privacy technology; but a lot of blockchain enthusiasts, developers and contributors do not know much about Zcash in most parts of Nigerian cities. Thus funding Zcash educational activities will help get more blockchain developers and crypto users to contribute to the Zcash ecosystem via the cities of Effurun, Agbarho, Enugu and Asaba.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Zcash WorkStation will enable easy setup of Zcash Educational Resources that is open and accessible. Zcash Academy and Zcash Bootcamp will be done in the cities of Effurun, Agbarho, Enugu and Asaba.

  The Format will be in the following. 1. Zcash Bootcamp , this will be an in-person training on everything Zcash in the cities of Effurun, Agbarho, Enugu and Asaba. Our goal is to have at least 25 persons in attendance in each of these ZCash Bootcamp making it a total of 100 persons minimum in all 4 cities. 2. Zcash Conversations , this is going to be a recorded 4 series of virtual interview with ZEC/Zcash experts on various topics on ZEC / Zcash towards educating the public. 3. Youtube videos. All sessions of the Zcash Bootcamp and Zcash Conversations will be recorded in post on a dedicated YouTube channels with links shared across my Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin and I intend to collaborate with others social media channels in spreading these videos. Our goal is to get a minimum of 10,000 views. 4. Branded Zcash WorkStation. We intend to brand all location for the Zcash Bootcamp and Conversation with Zcash logo and designs. 5. Community Contribution. In this case, we will encourage the participants of the Zcash Bootcamp to research and write an article on Zcash, which will be published on a dedicated Medium account with the published link shared across other social media. Our goal is to have at least 10 Zcash articles. 6. Documentary Video : A documentary video will be done towards covering the entire activities, as well as investigate proper on how well blockchain developers and crypto users are familiar with Zcash, thus providing an insight on how to get more people can be usher into the Zcash ecosystem. This documentary will be titled How well is Zcash known in Nigeria.
- **Dependencies:**
  This project is dependent on Zcash community members in availing themselves to be interviewed and to provide Zcash lectures to attendees in these 4 cities. Also, we will leverage on the WittyHub community towards publicizing this project to members and friends.
- **Technical approach:**
  Starting from Q2 of 2023 (April 2023) 1. Setting up of branded Zcash Workstations for 6 months in 4 cities. 2. Organized an 8 weeks Zcash Bootcamps in each of the 4 cities, which will be recorded. 3. Do a 4 series Zcash Conversation, where Zcash professionals will be interviewed. 4. Upload all videos to YouTube and share links appropriately on various social media channels. 5. Create a community contribution channels and make it open from the start. 6.
