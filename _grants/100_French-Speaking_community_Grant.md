- **Detailed Explanation:**
  Cointribune is France's leading media on Cryptocurrencies, Blockchain and Web3, with over 2 million views per month and a base of 650k+ active readers every month. As part of its development on the production of quality content, we have developed strategic partnerships with CoinMarketCap (with an exclusivity on the French-speaking part, we accompany them in the translation of all their reports into FR, as well as the implementation of their CMC Community tool), Tradingview, BusinessWire and Coinstats.app. For over a year now, we've also been working on the production of Evergreen content (cold content), designed to enhance the acculturation of partner projects. Finally, we are currently developing an off-chain "Read to Earn" (soft launch during this summer), to build reader loyalty by rewarding them for their reading time, in return for items/goodies purchasable on a points marketplace. We'll also be creating article quest paths to encourage loyal readers. Cointribune is part of our media group, which also includes the Cointelegraph France franchise. We also write 95% of the Blockchain, crypto, NFT and Web3 content for Forbes FR, with whom we've had a trusted relationship for over 2 years. https://www.cointribune.com/ https://fr.cointelegraph.com/ https://www.forbes.fr/author/frederic-bonelli/
