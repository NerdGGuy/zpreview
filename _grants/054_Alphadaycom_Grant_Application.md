- **Project Summary:**
  Building a Zcash community dashboard on Alphaday that aggregates news, social media, dev resources and more into one customizable UI.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Crypto has exploded in popularity over the last 4-5 years and there is so much going on that it’s almost impossible to keep up with everything. Our user research showed that users are overwhelmed with information and spend a lot of time jumping from one news source to another, from one social site to another, and usually have dozens of tabs open to stay up to date with everything happening in a community.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Our dashboard aims to provide a single end-point from which users can consume all the information on a project they could possibly want. In this case, we would like to build a Zcash Community Dashboard that aggregates all the discussions, talking points, narratives, events, metrics, official announcements and much much more into one single dashboard. With one glance at this dashboard Zcash community members would have a top-down view of what is happening across the entire Zcash ecosystem. From this view they could then jump deeper into their areas of interest (ie. devs to dev documentation, ZEC holders to twitter and reddit discussions, investors to on-chain metrics across both Zcash’s own pages and to third-party data providers).
- **Solution Format:**
  A website/App.
- **Dependencies:**
  Our work is independent of outside organizations but we would appreciate any shoutout on social media.
- **Technical approach:**
  We would like to create a Zcash (including Zcash foundation & Electronic Coin Co (ECC)) ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard: - The latest Zcash official announcements and blog post content ( https://electriccoin.co/blog/ , https://zfnd.org/blog/ , https://z.cash/news/ ) . - A feed of all news mentions of Zcash from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet. - A calendar containing all Zcash events including Zcash Governance votes, meetups/Zcon events, hackathons with Zcash/Electric Coin Co. bounties, AMAs. - Podcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by Zcash team members. - Youtube stream containing educational Zcash content. - Zcash Documentation directory. - Integration with Zcash Foundation Forum to show the latest and trending discussion topics. - Twitter, Discord, & Telegram Integration to show a feed of latest discussions. - FAQ, Devtools, Mining Guides, ZEC payment guides, links to exchanges listed & ZEC tokenomics information. - Zcash Foundation Careers integration to show the latest open jobs listed. - ZEC metrics, pulled from ECC (at a later stage).

  No
- **Total proposed grant value:**
  4900.0

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Alphaday
- **Background:**
  I’ve been involved in the Ethereum space since early 2016 and joined Kyber Network in 2017 as Head of Ecosystem Growth before quitting to start Alphaday full-time in 2021. Previously I worked at Thomson Reuters for a decade building financial products that rivaled the Bloomberg Terminal. I am currently also a Venture Partner at IOSG.VC. My co-founder Felipe has also been involved in Ethereum since 2016 and was a Developer Advocate at Pegasys and Consensys before quitting to work full time on Alphaday. Alphaday’s third co-founder is DeFiDude who used to be a community manager at both Aave and Kyber Network before co-founding Alphaday. https://www.linkedin.com/in/denizomer/ https://www.linkedin.com/in/faraggi/ https://twitter.com/defidude

### Funding History

- **Previous funding:**
  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  Yes
- **Other funding details:**
  We have received pre-seed money from Anthony Sassano, Mariano Conti, Signum, IOSG and a few other Ethereum-focused angel investors.

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  Building the Alphaday infrastructure was not easy as we pull so many different types of data from different sources. It took a team of 4 developers over a year building the engine that can pull the data, analyze it, and categorize and contextualize the data (ie. understanding different crypto concepts like NFTs, DeFi, Staking) so that users can find it easier to navigate through all the information. We’ve gotten over the hard part so we don’t expect any obstacles in the future.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  Our success would not impact anything detrimentally, so far as we can foresee.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Once we’ve created a Zcash dashboard, we will promote this across the Zcash community and start collecting feedback so that we can keep iterating and improving our dashboard. For us success is if a large number of Zcash stakeholders come to the Zcash dashboard to stay up to date with everything happening within Zcash and then use the available data as jumping off points into the various parts of the Zcash ecosystem. Ie. ZEC holders using the board to finding trending governance topics to participate in, devs using the resource library to dive deeper into the technical documents, newcomers listening to the latest podcasts and exploring open job positions at Zcash Labs. The grant work will result in a dashboard dedicated to serving the Zcash community by aggregating all relevant information about Zcash including media communities, on-chain metrics, Zcash academy, Zcash tokenomics into one place. Our desired outcome is to provide a new end-point for community engagement and to bolster Zcash’s outreach.
