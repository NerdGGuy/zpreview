- **Project Summary:**
  Training 10 African university students in ZCash programming, positively impacting lives and the African blockchain space

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Africa's youth make up a significant proportion of the population, but they are often left out of the formal economy and lack access to opportunities. This lack of access prevents them from thriving, resulting in high levels of unemployment and poverty, as well as social and political marginalization, and as a result, Africa cannot reach its full potential.
- **Proposed solution:**
  The value proposition of investing in Africa's youth is clear. They are the future leaders of the continent, and if given the opportunity, they have the potential to thrive. This program gives these young people a head-start in life by equipping them with future-proof skills, networking opportunities, and exposure that will not only empower them to improve their lives but also benefit society as a whole. Through the program, ZCash will be playing a key role in increasing the adoption and skillset pool for blockchain, web3 and crypto in Africa.
- **Solution Format:**
  The final deliverable after six months is to have a pool of ZCash developers from the program who can build applications on the ZCash network and contribute positively to the ZCash community.
- **Dependencies:**
  This program is dependent on ZF to fund its operations as well as resources and support from the community, such as mentorship.
- **Technical approach:**
  Approach: Developing the Course : We plan to develop a six-month program that includes virtual and physical components and focuses on ZCash programming. The course will include lectures, hands-on exercises, final exam and a capstone project. Resources for Students : We will provide students with resources such as reading materials, practice exercises, video links and online live discussions to help them in better understanding the topics. Program Implementatio n: We will design and implement the program in Kenya, which will include logistics and operations, as well as guidance and mentorship. Program Evaluation : We will be evaluating the program on a regular basis to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and that the students are making progress.

### Funding History

- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  Some potential obstacles that we might face include lack of adequate resources and funding, difficulty finding appropriate mentors and teaching staff, and difficulty ensuring the quality of the program. Unknown factors that could jeopardize success include the political climate in Kenya, the availability of reliable internet and infrastructure, and the level of enthusiasm and commitment of the students. In order for our work to be usable, the program must work closely with the ZCash community, ABYA university clubs and blockchain enthusiasts in the region.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  Usability : The program may be difficult for students to understand if the materials and resources provided are not properly designed or implemented. This could lead to a lack of understanding and, ultimately, a lack of application Privacy : The program may expose the students to security risks if their data is not properly protected. Interoperability : The program may not be able to integrate with other ABYA programs, limiting its potential reach. Maintainability : The program may not be able to keep up with the changing trends in the blockchain space, resulting in the students being unprepared for the future. Requisite Education : The program may not be able to provide the level of education necessary for the students to be successful in the blockchain space.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  We are committed to providing an evaluation plan to measure the success of the ABYA program. To this end, we will report the following quantitative metrics: Number of students trained Number of successful course completions Number of capstone projects completed Number of students employed in the blockchain/crypto space Number of students presented at conferences or events In addition to the quantitative metrics, we will also report the following qualitative metrics: Student feedback on the course and their experience Increase in knowledge and skillset of students Perception of the impact of the program by startups in the industry Quality of the capstone projects Overall success of the program in terms of its contribution to the blockchain/crypto space in Africa.
