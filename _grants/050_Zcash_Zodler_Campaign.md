  The Zodler Campaign - a multi-pronged song & video campaign to popularize the term ‘Zodler’ & Zcash spirit of freedom, privacy & community.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Over the past few months, as the influence of my Zcash anthem expanded, I found myself becoming a part of several crypto communities in India. It’s been an interesting journey and I have realized that the dominant sentiment in the Indian crypto community is positive. They are optimistic and willing to venture deep and wide into the crypto market. Mumbai is the financial capital of India and the prevailing sentiment in the city influences how the rest of the country thinks and moves in the financial domain. As a resident of Mumbai, and having interacted with financial communities across the board, I have also realized that Mumbai is rapidly becoming the hotspot of the crypto communities as well. A dedicated campaign spearheaded by someone like me who lives in Mumbai and has a good penetration in the crypto and financial circles is a great way to bridge this gap. Post the integration of Polygon with Meta, and Instagram announcing the launch of NFTs, crypto users in India have become even more privacy conscious and there is a prevailing sense that the existing cryptos may not be matching the expectations of the users in India in the context of privacy and freedom. The Indian crypto community, old and new users alike, are looking for something that is different, radical, and revolutionary. Something that can be a crusader of absolute freedom and unimpeachable privacy. In other words, they are looking for something exactly like Zcash. The market is ripe and ready. What is needed is to expand our outreach and make Zcash stand out on the virtue of its fantastic merits. In a world inundated with cryptos, we need to celebrate our uniqueness and authenticity and harness the positive emotion in the market through a focused campaign. The best way to do this I believe is by owning, celebrating, and showcasing our identity as Zcash users…a Zodler. We have to embrace and showcase our power as an individual and as a community. The Zcash community is not only a closely knit group of like-minded people but also a force to reckon with, and I want to create a fun, peppy, and super entertaining song campaign that celebrates our camaraderie, our spirit, our freedom, our commitment to privacy and our identity as a Zodler. The success and attention that the Zcash anthem received made me aware of the possibilities and opportunities that we could benefit from if we were to launch an extended campaign. And so, this time, I want to take this a notch higher and launch a dedicated campaign that will help old and new Zcash users reconnect with and celebrate the spirit of freedom and privacy that defines Zcash.
- **Proposed solution:**
  The Zodler song that I, along with a dedicated social media team, propose to create is a step beyond the Zcash anthem, and an essential next step in not only reinforcing the idea of Zcash as a whole but also celebrating our power and identity as Zcash users or the Zodlers. The ultimate goal is to increase awareness about Zcash across users and communities and harness the positive sentiment of the market to create a Zcash wave in India. This is a campaign that will harness the curious audience that the Zcash anthem has already prepped for us, the network that I have created in the Indian crypto community since the release of this anthem, and the insights we have gathered as a part of multiple crypto groups and conversations over the past few months. Much like the Zcash anthem, this will be a hummable and memorable number that will be designed to grab eyeballs while capturing the essence of the Zcash community. This will be a song that will capture our great differentiator, convey and celebrate how Zcash is different from other cryptos in the market, give new users a taste of what is in store for them, and underscore the greatest strengths of Zcash—our community and its commitment to freedom and privacy. While the Zcash anthem was about Zcash, this is a song about the most important element that makes Zcash great. This is a song about us—the Zcash users. Post Z-Con3 where we showcased our strength in numbers and as a community, it is only apt that we now also have a song that celebrates that very spirit. This campaign is not just about creating a song. As an extended 2 week campaign, we intend to not only capture attention but also hold it through multiple content pieces created and distributed around the song campaign. To this end, I along with a dedicated social media team, will : Release Zodler song & video across all video and streaming platforms including my Youtube Channel. Create official Zodler handles on Instagram and Twitter that will then be used to create, distribute and popularize the Zodler song through viral-worthy content pieces like memes, posts, and shorts around the song Promote the #IAMZodler hashtag across platforms Get Influencers on board and help us promote the Zodler song by pushing it through their handles Create and provide the community with a Zodler Pack that will contain the original downloadable track and video, two Zcash ringtones, and #IAMZodler graphics that can be used for posting on various platforms and merchandising purposes. Increased awareness about Zcash across new and old users, with a highlighted focus on the unmatchable privacy and freedom Zcash brings to the table for all the Zodlers. Additionally, the song will be made available under Creative Commons for all the community users and audience to experiment with and create their own fun videos, TikToks, and reels around it, thus adding to the buzz and the conversations around the Zcash community and us, the Zodlers! As with the Zcash anthem, the Zodler song will be accompanied by a finely conceived music video that will be released on my channel. It will be in sync with the spirit of the song and which will reinforce the faith in Zcash, will be a fun celebration for existing users and a beacon of hope for new and aspiring users.

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Hanu Dixit
- **Background:**
  I am a self-taught Singer-Songwriter and Music Composer/Producer based out of Mumbai, India. My YouTube Channel (https://www.youtube.com/hanudixit) has over 153,000 subscribers and counting to its credit. I am the creator of the very popular Zcash anthem released earlier this year which garnered over 115,000 views, 10K+ likes and comments, and much love across platforms. Not only was the anthem a massive success in terms of the number of views and reach, but it also made people more curious about Zcash and attracted several potential adopters. My DMs were flooded with inquiries about Zcash, and even now, months after the release of the song, the curiosity remains intact and I keep getting messages from people across the board who want to know more about Zcash. I have also joined several Indian crypto communities in the past few months and have realized that the penetration of my Zcash anthem has been deep and effective. Additionally, over the past year, I have expanded my profile and social media influence. Currently, I am working on an exciting new project with Google, and have been recently chosen as Nexa Music’s Top 24 Musicians in India. I will be featured by Rolling Stone and will be sharing space with the Academy Award Winner A.R Rahman next month. Based on the fact that my Zcash anthem has already given me a ready and curious audience who want to know more about Zcash, I plan to use my increased influence and social capital to promote the Zodler campaign more effectively. I am the brains behind multiple viral songs and music videos with a total of more than 20 million views. In the last two years, my viral original music series ‘If…Was A Song?’ ' where I created original songs around themes and icons from popular culture like the old Airtel jingle, Harry Potter, and The Avengers, among others, garnered me a Silver Button and attention from national and international media including The Hindu, Screenrant, Radiocity and BBC Lancashire. Apart from my work on Youtube, I have created commissioned soundtracks for brands like Google (that are some of the most downloaded and used tracks in the Youtube Audio Library), the Indian Brand Anthem for Clash of Clans where I created both the jingle and the video for it and have worked with over 60 brands in past 5 years to provide songs and music for them. My Original Songs are available on Spotify, JioSaavn, Apple Music, & Amazon Music, and my Youtube channel showcases my abilities not only as a music composer, but also as a filmmaker, and music video producer.
