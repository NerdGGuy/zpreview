### Event Details

- **Event Name:**
  Zcash Fesitval Brazil
- **Event Category:**
  Conference
- **Event Location:**
  Florianopolis, Brazil
- **Event Date:**
  3/29/2024
- **Target Audience:**
  English speaking, Spanish Speaking and Portuguese speaking crypto audience, Brazilian Zcash fans and Business development personek and devs who want to build on Zcash. As in size: We're aiming nothing less but surpass -and hopefully double - the second edition with around 500 physical attendees and at least 50.000 online viewers.
- **Detailed Explanation:**
  This is a community initiative that kicks off with launching a Zcash Crypto Festival with workshops, fireside chats and some special gamified experiences. Producing engaging videos and different types of compelling content as well. The workshops and presentations will serve as an excellent way to introduce & promote Zcash to the ever-growing crypto community in Latin America, both in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Which will then be followed with more educational content and weekly meetups to build the momentum. (We do luckily have an engaged local crypto community, and successful past events and we host weekly meetups and workshops for a couple of years already) Past participants include Beincrypto (3rd largest crypto outlet in the world), Animal Concerts (Metaverse platform with Snoop Dogg, Alicia Keys.. etc), Bitrefill, and many others. Here’s a video of past edition shared by one of the partners in the cross-marketing campaign: https://www.instagram.com/p/CmPEYZaA_q_/
- **Recording:**
  Yes
- **Benefit to Zcash:**
  We would love to help with is exposure in Latin America, content and community building. The event also allows for Co-marketing campaigns with some of the participants in order to create co-promotion material to be shared among social media channels thus multiplying the exposure.
   As past experiences have shown, this would likely result in a plethora of new clients, integration opportunities, co-marketing campaigns, and all sorts of collaborations and potential clients.
   After all, most builders, developers and business development teams appreciate live events for networking and collaboration opportunities. On top of all the video content we will create for the event. Clips of the fireside chats, as well as the presentation would serve as evergreen pieces of content for the Zcash community to use freely whenever they want. P.S: We believe that our team's combined experience would help launch a memorable event for Zcash.
