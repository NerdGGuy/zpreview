- **Project Summary:**
  Continued development of a premiere educational platform about Zcash, privacy, and related issues

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The general public does not know about Zcash, zero-knowledge proofs, the Zcash community, or how Zcash and its underlying technology applies to their lives. Beyond the problem of a lack of awareness, there is a steep learning curve for those that are interested in educating themselves about Zcash, which limits Zcash’s goal of being accessible to all. Our project will create a library of educational video content that will tackle numerous shortfalls in Zcash education and onboarding, a critical part of user experience. Please see our FAQ and Slide Deck for expanded answers.
- **Proposed solution:**
  In our view, the ultimate goal of all Dev Fund recipients is the same: increasing adoption of Zcash. We believe that everyone in the ecosystem has a role to play in achieving this goal. Our role in this collaborative effort is to educate, inspire, and excite current and future Zcashers, building a base of supporters that rivals the largest projects and beyond. To accomplish our task, we want to create a popular (1M+ subscribers) YouTube channel where viewers can be informed, inspired, and entertained about Zcash and related topics. We believe this will be an incredibly powerful tool to increase Zcash adoption. However, this is a long-term goal that will likely take years. To get there, we need to make videos that are valuable to a large number of people. Therefore, for this grant, as an important step in our long-term goal, we are proposing to make and distribute 20 videos that will simultaneously tackle Zcash communication challenges while growing our channel. Specifically, we aim to make all 20 videos in 12 months and start distributing videos 6 months after our start date at a minimum of one per month. Please see our FAQ and Slide Deck for expanded answers.
- **Solution Format:**
  Videos and supporting materials/events on Zcash Media channels. Please see our FAQ and Slide Deck for expanded answers.
- **Dependencies:**
  We are dependent on collaboration with experts in our “Explanations from Experts” series and we have already built relationships with relevant experts. We will also be dependent on further interviewees for certain video types, but our past experience has demonstrated that we are skilled at partnering with a wide variety of people to participate in our videos. We do not anticipate any major dependencies that would prevent us from accomplishing our goals.
- **Technical approach:**
  We will combine research, writing, video editing, voiceover, motion graphics, animation, coloring, sound design, and other video production techniques to make our videos, as we have demonstrated in the past.

### Requested Grant Amount

- **Amount:**
  900000.0

### Budget Breakdown

- **Hardware/Software budget:**
  0.0
- **Hardware/Software justification:**
  N/A

- **Services justification:**
  N/A
- **Compensation budget:**
  900000.0
- **Compensation justification:**
  Please see FAQ for expanded details. We first looked at the major problems that Zcash faces and proposed different video series that can address these problems. Then, for each video series, we estimated the people and time we would need to make the videos as high quality as possible. Using discounted industry standard rates, we calculated an estimated budget for each video series. While videos in each different series may need different budgets to create, the total for 20 videos over 12 months comes out to $900k.
- **Startup funding required:**
  Yes
- **Startup funding explanation:**
  In order to begin making the first batch of videos, we require startup funding.
- **Startup funding amount:**
  300000.0
- **Total proposed grant value:**
  900000.0

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  37 Laines
- **Background:**
  37 Laines has a track record of producing high quality content in a range of industries. As Zcash Media, we have produced and distributed two major videos for Zcash that were successful in inspiring and educating a wide range of audiences.

### Funding History

- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The greatest obstacle to success would be making sure our work gets seen and used outside the Zcash ecosystem, a challenge that every Zcash project faces. To overcome this, we will continue to apply our skillsets of storytelling, video production, and science education to make our videos valuable and inviting to a broad audience. Additionally, there is a risk that certain platforms we use (e.g., YouTube) may ban crypto content. Although we don’t consider this likely, we will post our videos on other platforms (e.g., Odyssee) to ensure they always remain reachable.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  By putting different people front and center in our videos, we risk unintended downsides if anyone featured were to have something extremely negative in their history or future come to light.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  We aim to keep Click-Through Rates and Retention measures above 4% and 40%, respectively. Please see FAQ for in-depth discussion of metrics.

### Project Timeline

- **Project timeline determination:**
  From our budget estimates, we determined how much time it would take to make different video series. Then, we estimated how we could break up the milestones so that we can have periods of 6 months to focus on specific deliverables. This allows us the time we need to focus on making the best possible videos, while also balancing the need to have accountability on hitting our deliverables.
