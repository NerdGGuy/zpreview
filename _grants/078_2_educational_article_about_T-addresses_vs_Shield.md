- **Project Summary:**
  A two-pieced educational long read featuring the comparison of T-addresses vs. Shielded/Unified Addresses.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  As stated in the Zcash community wishlist, the topic of T-addresses vs. Shielded/Unified addresses is something that needs more educational coverage which we’d be excited to provide. There is clearly an opportunity to create educational content on the topic to further share and promote it across the Zcash community.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Our solution is to create 2 long-read texts on the topic, around 8,000-10,000 symbols each. Moreover, we will do extensive marketing/promotional support for these texts: posting detailed infographics on social networks, do an FAQ session on Twitter or Reddit to answer additional questions. We are also open to consequently updating the materials upon request as the technology advances.
- **Solution Format:**
  2 long-read articles (8,000-10,000 symbols each) 3-5 infographics with articles recap for an eased visual perception Social media announcements about completed work FAQ session on Twitter/Reddit Updates to the material upon request
- **Dependencies:**
  Our proposal is not dependent on any external entities as we are to complete it entirely by ourselves. The only involvement from ZF/ECC that might be needed is to share their view on the texts’ structure and outline the most important emphases to be covered within the educational materials. We are not entirely sure how the publishing of the materials would go: we can provide our company blog as a primary platform for publication, linking back ZF and ECC as contributors and supporters of the work. However, if ZF/ECC plans to publish the work on their resources, we are also open to it as long as the material is linked to our company page as a credit to original creators.
- **Technical approach:**
  Expected structure of the articles:
   Article 1. Transactions Obfuscation in Crypto: Technologies, Challenges, and Limitations The first longread will address all main use-cases of transactional data obfuscation in cryptocurrencies. It will be a recap of the most popular ‘privacy narratives’: obfuscating addresses/contracts in Bitcoin and Ethereum, MimbleWimble implementations in Grin and Litecoin, ring signatures and earliest privacy coins (Bytecoin, Monero), ZK-proofs and their various implementations, and so on. We are going to display the economic rationale behind this or that development, its key technical features, core points of criticism and limitations. Then, we’ll demonstrate the role of Zcash and its innovations in this workload as a natural phase of advanced privacy in crypto. Additionally, we are going to review the most important use-cases of ‘privacy coins’ in 2023 and promising directions of future development. Article 2. Transparent and Shielded Addresses in Zcash: 101 for Newcomers Unlike Article 1, this text will be focused on educating potential users with a basic level of cryptocurrency skills. Thus, we’ll describe the concept of privacy in crypto and main ‘privacy coins’ in layman’s terms. To start with, we’ll explain the difference between ‘privacy coins’ and other cryptocurrencies from various points of view (users, regulators, scammers, entrepreneurs, investors). Then, we will review the history of Zcash, its unique features and role in the privacy coins narrative. We will cover the motivation behind the introduction of Z-addresses and T-addresses (different use-cases, different audiences, etc.) and demonstrate them ‘in action’. The opportunity to combine the usage of various types of addresses will also be covered. As a result, potential users will be able to utilize Zcash for daily payments and have a clear understanding of ‘obfuscation’ definition in cryptocurrency.

  Our total compensation budget is $5,000. An average market price of an experienced industry-specific author on blockchain- or web3-related subjects usually rests around $2,500-3000 per piece. Since we aim at providing 2 pieces along with promotional social network support and an interactive FAQ session for the readers, we believe that $6,000 should cover the expenses for the work of our copywriter, developers’ fact-checking, infographics design and social media marketing activities.

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  As of now, we do not foresee any obstacles or risks to the proposal completion.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  N/A
- **Evaluation plan:**
  In case of educational materials, we can rely on tracking such performance indicators as: Quantitative: weekly/monthly number of readers (users/page visitors), monthly number of interactions Qualitative: any comments the community has to leave upon reading the materials

### Project Timeline

- **Project timeline determination:**
  We want to ensure the educational materials we prepare are technically correct as well as understandable for both newbies and blockchain-savvy individuals. Our copywriter usually takes a week to complete a comprehensive long-read article, however, in this case we take an extra week to work with developers and find more room for editing and updating. Thus, each piece would take 2 weeks. Marketing and promotional support is expected to be carried out within a week. We can start with infographics design in advance, as soon as the articles are ready and approved to have the graphic materials ready for posting during the expected timeframe. The date for the 1st milestone is set supposing that the grant will be reviewed and approved during the following 2 weeks.
