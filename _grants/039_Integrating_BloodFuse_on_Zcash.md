- **Project Summary:**
  BloodFuse is a Web3 blood donation platform that connects blood donors to blood banks and integrating Zcash into it will add to Zcash value.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Statistics shows that over one million units of blood is required to save the lives of those in need of blood in Nigeria yearly but only about one hundred thousand units are received, thus making it a major challenge in Nigeria and the demand for blood is very high. Thus the concept of BloodFuse was delivered, to address the scarcity of blood and save lives in Nigeria.
- **Proposed solution:**
  BloodFuse is a web 3 blood donation platform that connects the nearest blood donors to blood banks, hospitals and blood donation centers in need of blood. Payments and reimbursement can be done using cash and crypto. The crypto payment to be accepted is STXs and we are integrating BTCPay API. However we want users on BloodFuse to have the option of making their transactions either to be Private or Public, thus the need to integrate Zcashd-wallet-tool. BloodFuse will be of great benefit to the entire Zcash ecosystem as community members can leverage on the platform to save their lives and that of their loves in need of blood. Also, the usage of Zcashd wallet will add value to the Zcash community, in addition to the fact that transactions can be done on BloodFuse using ZEC and users will then be holders of ZEC.
- **Solution Format:**
  A web3 blood donation platform that connects blood donors to the nearest blood banks and hospitals in need of blood. With the Zcashd wallet integration, in order for users to have Zcash wallets and thus make payment and reimbursement using ZEC.
- **Dependencies:**
  1. We will consult with the ZF, ECC and the Zcash community as regards this project. 2. We will rely on Figma for the designs modification. 3. We will integrate the Zcashd wallet and Zcash Payment APIs 4. We will integrate the CoinGecko API for the Zcash Prize update 5. I am working with CodeUp Technologies Limited for the project re-design and development.
- **Technical approach:**
  1. UI/UX Design modification on figma, to accommodate Zcashd wallet integration and Zcash Payment APIs 2. Conversion of new figma designs files to React/Javascript and Tailwind CSS 3. Home page and dashboard modification 4. Database modification 5. API integration and wallets creation 6. Testing, Debugging and Deploying 7. Launch and Maintenance

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  Blood donation is a very sensitive and risky activity to perform, thus any form of error in connecting a wrong donor could lead to delay and possibly a death case. But we are leveraging on proper matching of blood donor via the BloodFuse Web3 platform.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  The success of BloodFuse will lead to increase in blood supply and thus save over 70% of Nigerian lives in need of blood. Also, members of Zcash community can leverage on BloodFuse to save themselves or loved ones when in need of blood.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  The impact of BloodFuse can ascertained by: 1. The number of registered blood donors on BloodFuse 2. The number of blood units donated 3. The number of reimbursement made for blood processing 4. The equivalent amount of transactions in ZEC.
