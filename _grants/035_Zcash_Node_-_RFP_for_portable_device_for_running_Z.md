- **Project Summary:**
  A simple device for running the Zcashd node without any programming , linux installation or shell interaction.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Lack of plug and play capable devices for running Zcash nodes which is preventing involvement of more Zcash enthusiasts running the node from their home.
- **Proposed solution:**
  The goal of this project is to make it easier to run a Zcash node and related server side software by removing technical difficulties for users. This can be accomplished by building a plug-and-play full node from scratch or integrating Zcash into an existing hardware device.
- **Solution Format:**
  A completely customized linux distro for installing on dev boards , which can start serving Zcash node without any setup. The distro is capable of running ZCASHD and ZEBRAD without any installation or logging to terminal. By leveraging a cron job to check for updates regularly , node is kept running the latest version. User can effortlessly setup the node just by installing the linux image on to their device and forget the pain of installing a hundred packages and libraries.
- **Dependencies:**
  Inorder for our project to be a success, users and enthusiasts has to start running ZCash nodes from the comfort of their home using our finished device and software stack.
- **Technical approach:**
  SBC for the project - Raspberry Pi CM4 Carrier board for SBC - Custom board or waveshare nano carrier board for CM4 OS - Custom made Linux OS using Yocto User Interface - Android App and a web app for user interaction and web shell Documentation - Gitbook and a series of video tutorials.
