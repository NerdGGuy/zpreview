  Conference
- **Event Location:**

- **Event Date:**
  12/28/2022
- **Target Audience:**
  We are looking at about 3 - 5 panelists, and over 70 audience.
- **Detailed Explanation:**
  Over 10,000 persons and organizations in Nigeria are working tirelessly for the advancement of Blockchain Technology via community education and project execution, and over 80 percent of these people are not noticed nor recognized for their works. Therefore we deem it necessary to have a conversation on blockchain technology and its application, as well as present awards to key contributors to the advancement of blockchain in the city of Warri, Nigeria. This is going to be a one day event with about 3 to 5 experts in the blockchain space in Nigeria to be invited for panelists conversation, together with a listening audience of over 70 persons. The goal is educate more people about blockchain as well as to encourage those contributing with the awards. This event is going to be a physically attended one and it will be holding at the WittyHub, Events Space, Effurun, Nigeria where all participants will be provided with refreshment. Also, we intend to secure part sponsorship from Zcash, where links to the event photos and recording will be sent to the appropriate Zcash channel for record purpose, few days after the event. We intend to broadcast this event in our local TV station, as well as social media channels (Twitter, Facebook, & YouTube) with sponsors being appropriately acknowledged. All our sponsors logo will be capture in the event materials which include handbills, flyers, banners and brochure.
- **Recording:**
  Yes
- **Benefit to Zcash:**
  Sponsors will gain publicity through the event because sponsors logo will be on all printed materials of the event, and they will be acknowledged also via our social media channels too, thereby giving Zcash a high level publicity. Also, we intend to dedicate a 10-15 minutes session of the event to present Zcash to the audience, this can be done via a Zcash representative or through a video played to the audience.
- **Other Funding:**
  We have reach out out to Vorem Nigeria and we are expecting their response, however WittyHub is supporting with a discounted amount in their event space. We hope to get more support soon.

  Zcash logo and a 10-15 video introducing Zcash to the audience, which will be played during the event.
