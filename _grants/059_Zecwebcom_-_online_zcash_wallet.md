### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Increase consumer choice in the zcash wallet market. Currently the options to access zcash in the browser are limited. As well, the zcash wallet market has experienced a great deal of difficulty in user experience.Zecweb.com’s opportunity is offering internet users with a browser based zcash web-wallet. Zcash users will have access to a browser zcash wallet to any connected device. We offer three online subscription services. Each user receives a unique url to login to their web-wallet, inside their web-wallet each user can send & receive zcash from sapling & orchard pools, send messages and have a zcash address book. Depending on the subscription the wallet is supported by either a pruned node or a full node.The zcash community will benefit by having more consumer choice in the type of zcash wallet options available in the market.

- **Dependencies:**
