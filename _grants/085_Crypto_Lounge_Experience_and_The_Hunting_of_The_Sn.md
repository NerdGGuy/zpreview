### Event Details

- **Event Name:**
  The Crypto Lounge Experience
- **Event Category:**
  Conference
- **Event Location:**
  Soho House Barcelona - https://www.sohohouse.com/event-spaces
- **Event Date:**
  7/29/2023
- **Target Audience:**
  We are aiming at the crypto builder, research and developer community of Europe (and those who will come to zkWeek in Barcelona) - we plan on hosting around 100 people at this exclussive event.
- **Detailed Explanation:**
  *ALL INFO IS INCLUDED IN THIS DECK -* https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o6kQ5qlXmA9ZavBXErbD7QGBLulnMVyKkpTba10KWxw/edit?usp=sharing *USD3,821 is euro equivalent of the "Assembly of Teachers" sponsorship* The Crypto Lounge Experience We are organizing a one-day event on Saturday 29th July as part of the zkWeek (Zcon4 and ZKProof 5.5) in Barcelona . It has been conceived as a new concept of conference in cryptography, featuring a treasure hunt, inspiring conversations, intimate tutorials and powerful experiences around human connection, the impact of cryptography in society and intentionality around building in the space. But we need your help to make this come true! All of this will be delivered by the top speakers and facilitators in the space, with the goal of making participants learn by experiencing, while strengthening bonds, and inspiring collaboration between teams in the space. More information can be found here - https://www.cryptolounge.dev/ Confirmed speakers include Mary Maller (Ethereum Foundation), Anca Nitulescu (Protocol Labs / Filecoin), Darío Fiore (IMDEA Institute), Miguel Ambrona (Nomadic Labs), Luis Brandão (NIST), Chaitanya Konda (Espresso Systems), Ying Tong (Geometry) and many more to be confirmed. There will be both cryptographic sessions for interacting uniquely around technical content, as well as experiential sessions focused on the human condition and the future of society, which will be aligned with the main story line of the event, as described in the deck and the website. The type of cryptographic activities that we are planning to provide include: Hexagon table: intimate unrecorded sessions to teach ZK concepts in a "petit-commitée". As a facilitator you would engage with 5 other people to share your knowledge about a specific topic like polynomial commitments, sum check protocols, folding schemes, recursive composition, elliptic curve cycles, etc. Hands-on Workshops: live tutorial about a certain tech, protocol or application; or a hands-on-explanation of some development tool. Fireside chats: join another expert in the space to have a conversation about a hot topic (feel free to say who and about what). House of genius: as a facilitator you can propose and introduce the topic of discussion, ideally to be an open problem (in research, business, operations, or other types related to ZK and cryptography). The participants will use their creative thinking to help solve the problem or open question. Treasure Hunt: help us build and moderate the "Hunting of the SNARK", a large treasure hunt that will span online and IRL for the whole day of the event. We would love to have the Zcash community be a main partner of this event, so that we can also create the Treasure Hunt around the Zcash ecosystem
- **Recording:**
  No
- **Benefit to Zcash:**
  In two main ways: 1. Since the event is tied to Zcon4, this sponsorship would allow us to bring many of the Zcon4 / Zcash participants with a scolarship (currently more limited). 2. By sponsoring, the ZCG and ZF would get a wide exposure, not only from all the attendees and partners, but also from all those engaging with the treasure hunt, as we would be using the Zcash blockchain (think - memo field on shielded notes) to transmit / hide different information and clues pertaining to the treasure hunt.
- **Other Funding:**
  - Inversed Technologies - The Zcash Foundation - O(1) Labs
- **Materials Needed:**
  We will need the logo of the Zcash Community Grants, as well as knowing who will be coming to claim the tickets available as part of the package. Once we confirm we will also engage to plan for the treasure hunt and the curated house of genious session.
- **Sponsorship Recognition:**
  There will be plenty of exposure as explained in the sponsorship deck in the "benefits slide" - logo on website and branding material - dedicated online world for digital interaction - treasure hunt partner - dedicated / branding house of genious session - branded specialty experience
- **Terms Acceptance:**
  checked
