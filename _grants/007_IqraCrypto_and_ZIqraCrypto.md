- **Project Summary:**
  E-Learning Blockchain and Crypto Platform for the MENA Region

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  In the growing education sector, scholars find so many options for online learning and training with so many limitations, which students feel after paying heavy fees. People in the MENA Region (Arabic Speakers), they dont have a reference or a platform where to learn about crypto at their own pace and in their own language. Most of the Ads seen by Arabs, are from new crypto ICO, IEO or IDO and mostly are scams, this is why the region was behind in this. I did a survey recently most of the people in the MENA Region never heard of ZCash!
- **Proposed solution:**
  It provides an easy interface of website for students to find information easily & study material given in a systematic format. Iqracrypto is a perfect platform and provides various educational solutions for an affordable fee. •Courses in Arabic •Assessments and Quizzes •Recognized Certificates •One on one Sessions •Live Sessions Other than having the usual platform of IqraCrypto, we will develop ZiqraCrypto, which is the same platform but this one dedicated only to ZCash community in Arabic! Courses, Articles and guides about ZCash will all be available in there.
- **Solution Format:**
  •Courses in Arabic •Assessments and Quizzes •Recognized Certificates •One on one Sessions •Live Sessions
- **Dependencies:**
  Payment Operators risks that could refuse working with IqraCrypto but we could find a solution A small risk of delay with the translation of documents and editions, but we don't see this as a big problem
- **Technical approach:**
  Courses are being created, recorded and uploaded by me. LMS Platform where users can see their progress Payment Methods Live sessions
