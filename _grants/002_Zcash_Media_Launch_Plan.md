  Proposal to launch Zcash Media - a multi-platform educational hub for Zcash

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  While cryptocurrency has seen more large-scale adoption in recent years, conversation about cryptocurrency and coin adoption can often be fraught and complicated. Zcash’s powerful tech, historical relevance, and solution to the privacy problem has yet to be promoted on a large-scale. This has led to a lack of wider public awareness, difficulty in onboarding new users, and less awareness of Zcash’s development to ZEC holders and users. To counter this, 37 Laines has made two high-quality, entertaining, and educational videos about Zcash that feature world-famous interviewees and cutting edge education. However, without a proper distribution plan, there is a large risk of the videos not breaking through to a large audience. To overcome this challenge, we propose a distribution and marketing plan to help Zcash on its path to becoming a world-famous cryptocurrency known for its integrity, scientific rigor, high-profile supporters, and mission-based ethos.
- **Proposed solution:**
  37 Laines has assembled a distribution and marketing team to build out an entity we are calling "Zcash Media". In this way, Zcash Media will not only have the content creators necessary to make high-quality educational videos, but we will also be able to make sure the release of our two ZCG-funded videos adds another storied moment in Zcash’s history. Zcash Media proposes to build a vibrant ecosystem of researchers, content creators, and digital strategists all working in conjunction with the Zcash community [ please see associated long form proposal ]. The Digital Media team will strategize on “What audiences see” including release of videos on YouTube and promotional content on related channels. The “Strategy to support the ecosystem” will be led by the Public Relations team to connect with media outlets, perform market research, counsel Zcash Media on how to bring awareness to Zcash on a global scale, and work in collaboration with ECC, ZF, ZCG, and Zcash community to help attain a unified voice. The research and content creation teams will lead the production of video content with input from Public Relations R+D arm. For this current proposal, the Zcash Media ecosystem aims (i) establish its presence on various social media platforms, (ii) launch our Tier 0 short documentary, and (iii) launch our video explaining the Halo upgrade and revealing the identity of John Dobbertin. The activities surrounding these aims are outlined in the following sections.
- **Solution Format:**
  Creation of Zcash Media channels on YouTube, Odysee, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and promotional materials released on additional social media platforms (e.g., Telegram, Reddit). In addition, we will feature promotional materials on third-party media outlets related to the release of our educational videos. Our two ZCG-funded videos will be released in their entirety on YouTube and Odysee.
- **Dependencies:**
  At the moment, our work does not depend on external organizations. Our main dependency is the video hosting and social media platforms that we will be posting material on. In addition, although our proposal could be completed without further collaborations, we think it is important to work in conjunction with ZF, ECC, and the Global Ambassadors Program to ensure united messaging.
- **Technical approach:**
  Our technical approach includes a comprehensive digital marketing and public relations strategy. PLEASE SEE LONG FORM PROPOSAL FOR FULL APPROACH.

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The primary concern to consider when executing the proposed campaign is to ensure the community feels that we are aligned with Zcash’s ethos/principals. To address this, all of our decision-making and output is crafted to keep the Zcash community/ethos front-and-center. We have continuously met with and had Zcash stakeholders review our work and plans, and have only proceeded when consensus among all parties is reached. Another important risk is the ability to stand out in the massive crowd of crypto YouTube channels. However, we believe the production quality, marketing strategy, and high-profile individuals featured in our work will allow us to stand out. Lastly, some risk of censorship exists due to the moderation policies of large companies like Google surrounding cryptocurrency advertising. However, we plan to address this in two ways: 1) our content is clearly educational in nature with talking head interviews and explainer animations. This should mitigate the risk of being seen as an advertisement. 2) We will simultaneously use the Odysee video hosting platform to put our educational videos. Odysee is less susceptible to censorship than YouTube.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  By putting different people front and center in our videos, we risk unintended downsides if anyone featured were to have something extremely negative in their history or future come to light.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  We will share a comprehensive review to the Zcash Community at the end of our launch phase. This will include detailed evaluation metrics from our marketing campaign gathered from all our social media sites. These include, but are not limited to: number of views, impressions, watch time, and mentions. In addition, our project can be evaluated qualitatively by soliciting community feedback on the success of Zcash Media's launch.

### Project Timeline

- **Project timeline determination:**
  The project timeline was determined such that the release of our two main videos occurs before the NU5 upgrade goes live. This will allow maximum exposure to not only our videos, but to the Zcash NU5 upgrade. In general, we aim to release our ZCG-funded educational videos on a regular cadence (weekly/biweekly) to build our YouTube/Odysee following.
