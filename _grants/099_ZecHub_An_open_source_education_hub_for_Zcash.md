- **Project Summary:**
  This proposal seeks to grow Zcash’s open-source education hub and onboard more contributors to Zcash.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  ZecHub will provide an open source educational platform where community members can work together on creating, validating, and promoting content that supports the Zcash ecosystem.
- **Proposed solution:**
  In an open-source manner, ZecHub provides easy to understand education resources, a ZecWeekly Newsletter, Wallet Demos, Video explainers on Zcash centric topics such as 'Zcash Explained' and a Podcast. Anyone can review the documentation for accuracy, create new content and use the hub’s structure to facilitate new ideas that benefit the hub’s education stack and the Zcash ecosystem. This process has incentivized community members to become more active contributors to Zcash and adjacent crypto ecosystem communities to come in and eventually contribute to the protocol. ZecHub rewards every contribution by distributing ZEC from a pool of funds that is overseen by the DAO. The DAO also controls the DaoDao based multisig with funds from many leading Cosmos based chains. We focus on advancing Zcash education and provide a uniform process for anyone to earn ZEC. Future grants: We have every intention of continuing our work beyond 5 months however with the state of the market we appreciate some in the community may have concerns about cost. With that said, we opted to have a 5 month grant with the option for another grant if and when ZecHub is needed with efforts in the Decentralizing Digital Task Force
- **Solution Format:**
  The format of the work will be: Zcash Wikipedia Zcash Ecosystem Weekly Newsletter Consistent Zcash education for Twitter News, podcasts and other video content for social media Zcash Wallet tutorials Zcash User guides Twitter spaces / Community events Easy to understand articles about Zcash Media about other privacy projects (i.e. Namada/Agoric ), which can introduce them to Zcash ZecHub Extras patronage program See some of our past work: Comparing on-chain privacy technologies Zcash Explained: The Namada<>Zcash Strategic Alliance Social Media data collection, does it matter? | Cypherpunk Times Article ZGo Payment Processor | Wiki page ZecHub Magazine ZecHub Merch Store
- **Dependencies:**
  The podcast and twitter spaces events are dependent on Zcash community members and other projects being open to attending. ZecHub is dependent on its DAO members and open-source contributors to see the platform thrive.
- **Technical approach:**
  Starting in January 2024: - Manage the Zcash ecosystem weekly newsletter which is translated in 7 languages - Open-sourced education materials. Anyone can contribute. - Continue our process of issuing bounties and paying contributors on a weekly basis - We have a community-led DAO to ensure the hub’s strategic direction includes a diverse set of voices - Our DAO votes on all major changes related to the Hub including SubDAO proposals - Anyone can use our materials to support their own channels. For example, Zcash en Español.

### Funding History

- **Previous funding:**
  Yes
- **Previous funding details:**
  Period: January 2023 - December 2023 ZecHub was founded by Espresso Systems' Ian Sagstetter as an open-source education hub for Zcash. It has since grown to 78 members on Dework & 35 contributors on Github. It has hosted several community events and has proven that further decentralization of access to Zcash development funding can be used to effectively leverage the incredible talent and enthusiasm of community members, attracting new people and attention from aligned communities.
- **Other funding sources:**
  Yes
- **Other funding details:**
  We are currently participating in the Namada Community Builders Program. It distributes NAM based on votes acquired from other contributors over each epoch (one month). We are also seeking a grant submission to the Decentralized Cooperation Foundation (DCF). They emphasize Agoric’s proof-of-stake chain and the Cosmos-focused IBC environment with the primary goal of better cooperation between projects.

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The biggest execution risk would be misallocation of the Bounty Pool. It is vital that ample time is provided for project planning. Specifically Tasks, Services and Events need to be budgeted for in advance. Another education risk is the hub’s dependency on one person for media materials. There should be a strong focus on developing more content creators for the hub.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  N/A
- **Evaluation plan:**
  The main metrics related to ZecHub’s success are social media metrics (followers, video views, newsletter subscribers, etc) and the number of contributors building ZecHub related items. Here are the metrics from ZecHub’s first year: Primary Social Media Following: Twitter - 950 followers YouTube - 295 subscribers Newsletter - 200 subscribers A high level overview. We average 2-10k Impressions per post on twitter. Our youtube videos average 100 - 500 views. A monthly report will be published with all relevant key performance indicators. We have consistently delivered quality social media content. Posts include announcements, wiki documentation, newsletters, podcasts, video tutorials, surveys and threads. If we can make further effort towards our engagement numbers, and grow our social media following along the way, then we would have a successful year in this regard. We will also post content that appeals to crypto ecosystems outside the Zcash community. For example, Decred, Namada and Agoric. This also provides an avenue of exploration for supplementing our funding streams. If we do this frequently, with ecosystems that are aligned with Zcash, we can grow our following and engagement outside of Zcash. We believe this will bring more people to ZecHub as followers and potential contributors. This widens the net for potential engagement and growth on social media. We are also able to create educational material such as videos, posters and programs that can be used alongside the main z.cash website and potentially Zcash Global Ambassador seminars or classes. We will provide a monthly social media report for the community. You can view our main social media channels below: Twitter Youtube Substack We will also strive to grow other social media channels that are more decentralized: Bluesky Farcaster Mastodon BisonRelay Matrix Contributor Count: ZecHub has had We believe this is the most important metric, We view everything, docs, podcasts, social media, etc., as a means to bring in committed contributors to Zcash. When these contributors are actively playing their part in Zcash education, they will have more things to post about Zcash on social media, in their online communities, IRL, and this will amplify ZecHub and Zcash’s work past our own follower base. Our goal for 2024 is to see 30 new Zcashers contribute to ZecHub, bringing its contributor count to 65. This will be done via our contributor onboarding process, and community management.
