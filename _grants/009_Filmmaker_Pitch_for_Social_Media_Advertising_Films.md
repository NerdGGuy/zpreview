- **Project Summary:**
  Hi I'm Rowen, a filmmaker from Welkom. I am raising funds for new equipment, and post-production overheads for the winter to produce films.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  I am going to keep it short and sweet. The equipment and overheads to be a full-service agency independent video creator is difficult. and I would like to improve with a starting point of just buying some better gear and finding local clients, who can pay little, while some of my overheads are covered through the funders. When you film a local marketing video on a Canon 90D with Cinema Lenses, by renting it out, you lose about 70% of your income, so all in all, every project, is a risk, with a -70% loss. With your support, I can somehow crunch the numbers to buying my own gear, which will allow the production costs to go to about 10% or so, allowing me to maintain and manage cheaper clients.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Creating a season of creative projects that are self created, for clients, who get promoted, with great quality gear and project value, who cant always afford agency level prices.
- **Solution Format:**
  A series of video/photo related projects, each to a scope of 1000$, ongoing. Short Films, Comedy Skits, etc.
- **Dependencies:**
  I would like to approach firms & corporations that could in some way sponsor my venture to become a full-service production agency in South Africa with a 8 year plan to 2030, hopefully working with the UN on global procurement for projects and creative service retainers. The funds I am requesting would be any tax deductible or ad-hoc finances left over from global firms and companies that would accumulate and allow me to make the necessary purchase or to take on 2022 with fresh new camera and studio assets.
- **Technical approach:**
  The idea is to find corporations & firms that can hand down tax deductible funds directly or through Payoneer or PayPal, even Crypto Currency funding can work. I thought about a cause or charity to donate towards, but in truth, I can't really move into the activist fundraising space for NGO's mainly because corporations & firms have dedicated foundations to which they contribute towards with tax regulations and fiscal sponsorship policies in place already.

### Requested Grant Amount

- **Amount:**
  1000.0

### Budget Breakdown

- **Hardware/Software budget:**
  5000.0
- **Hardware/Software justification:**
  With the finances raised through my Payoneer and or PayPal Account, the goal is to purchase professional videography, photography & studio equipment which can be quite costly and not always financially feasible for clients to contribute towards when filming as most projects only really pay for the service of the creative production. What I really need all the little bits & pieces, expensive photography lenses, sound mics & mixers Illustrator tablets, solid state hard drives, wireless keyboards, camera rigs, attachments & mounts among the various other items needed in video production like camera bags, good tripods, camera straps memory card readers & fast SD cards, video monitors & viewfinders with a whole range of video & photo cameras on the market today.
- **Services budget:**
  500.0
- **Services justification:**
  Adobe Suites, Artlist, Argrid, and selected subscriptions, like MS Office and Dropbox etc.
- **Compensation budget:**
  500.0
- **Compensation justification:**
  Myself, Rowen Smith, Producer and filmmaker. 100$ -500$ All other costs go towards the savings fund, gear costings, agency overheads and inceptive for cast being used. Crew of 1-5 of about 50$ per day, Cast about 50$ per day. Production about 1000$ per day.
- **Startup funding required:**
  Yes
- **Startup funding explanation:**

- **Startup funding amount:**
  2000.0
- **Total proposed grant value:**
  5000.0

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Cignalhill Pty Ltd, South Africa, Mr. Rowen Smith
- **Background:**
  Hello everyone. My name is Rowen Smith, I am 32, and I am a photographer and filmmaker from Welkom. I am trying to create a market where short films are shot on Mirrorless and DSLR cameras, with proper budget for micro narratives, which I then offer to local customers in Welkom, like the Butchery, to sponsor whatever they can. Basically I am looking for some funds, anything from 500$ to 50 000$ or more. The funds will go directly into a costed breakdown, a separate bank account and paid out each month, like an incentive. This incentive is for the production of each new project, seen as a contribution, while some funds are kept safe for overheads, gear and tech upgrades for my editing suite. My goal is to recode my website, and publish all my old projects, as well as a new slate of projects. that are funded by sponsors, and the throughout the year.

### Funding History

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  I've mostly shot my photography & social media videos on a Canon 500D, a 50mm F1.8 and a 24mm F2.8 Pancake lens. This year I've sent various video, photo and documentary pitches out to global NGO's & United Nations Agencies for multimedia, photography & videography consultancies in Africa, Asia and even the French Territories. My quotes are quite expensive since a lot of the gear I need for my company I need to rent per day Including VAT from local retailers, which makes my bid quite out of reach, unless I find a better way.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  If the project works, I will be able to fulltime produce, film and direct my own narratives, with people. who are also casted and getting some income from the shoots. The negative side if the project is that it gives clients really great creative value, for a lot less than the industry should be paying, but in our economic state, adaption to find solutions is a key focus, rather than waiting another 10 years to make a feature film with a multimillion dollar budget which might never get made.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  I've mostly shot my photography & social media videos on a Canon 500D, a 50mm F1.8 and a 24mm F2.8 Pancake lens. This year I've sent various video, photo and documentary pitches out to global NGO's & United Nations Agencies for multimedia, photography & videography consultancies in Africa, Asia and even the French Territories. My quotes are quite expensive since a lot of the gear I need for my company I need to rent per day Including VAT from local retailers, which makes my bid quite out of reach, unless I find a better way. The reward we offer to all our funders & backers, is to produce a Web series called Welkom in Welkom (Welcome in Welkom). This was once a feature film script I started writing in 2012 and finalized as a 73 page Micro Budget Feature Film submitted for Netflix with official feedback from the Netflix Evaluation Panel. Weâ€™ve adapted & rewritten the core concept into a web series that we can produce monthly with the newly acquired studio assets purchased. We will be filming, cutting & putting this web series together throughout 2022, releasing social media promotional versions we send out to local businesses for sponsorship & financial advertising for every episode, along with showcasing the web series on a custom web domain for all our investors and financiers to enjoy. Along with shooting various spec films, and video/photo concepts with the newly purchased gear, from funds raised.

### Project Timeline

- **Project timeline determination:**
  Over the years, freelancers have spontaneous workflows, routines and career schedules within the industry. What we are trying to do, is create a product, that is in the form of a series of videos, sitcoms, comedy skits, parody short films etc. filmed in the scope of DSLR, Mirrorless Equipment, moving back from Medium, Large/Cinema Format Industry processes, into freelance/videography filmmaking, integrating Film/Cinema and narrative, back into advertising, with narrative driven stories, filmed, cheaply, and then product placing small businesses, for income. The timeline is then thought of as a universal month to month retainer income, that has a 30 day, 12 month financial year to it, a locked in budget, taxes and all finances in place like it is a big pizza, being made each month, slice by slice.
