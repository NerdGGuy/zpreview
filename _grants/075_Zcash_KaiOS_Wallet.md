- **Project Summary:**
  We are looking to build first KaiOS non-custodial wallet for Zcash.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Currently there is no KaiOS wallet available for Zcash. KaiOS is the world's third largest OS with active 160 million plus devices particularly from countries like Africa, Asia and South America. There's a great opportunity to on-board these users into the Zcash ecosystem and empower them with Zcash payment solutions.
- **Proposed solution:**
  We will be creating a mobile wallet for low specs phone working on KaiOS that has 160M+ users globally where people can create and import their wallet where they can do transactions and share address either via whatsapp and other social media platforms or through scanning QR codes of the addresses that makes transactions easier. We will make a comprehensive and easy to use UI to ease the onboarding process for the KaiOS users into the Zcash ecosystem.
- **Solution Format:**
  A Zcash wallet on KaiOS which can be easily download through the app store and used by millions of KaiOS devices.
- **Dependencies:**
  Our team will take care of the development of the wallet. There is no involvement required from ZF and ECC. Our wallet will be available through the KaiOS app store.
- **Technical approach:**
  1. Integrate the initial workflow as per Zcash wallet creation. 2. Enhance the UI for better performance. 3. Build / integrate libraries for the application that can create and import wallet and make sure that we secure it. 4. Build / integrate libraries for the application that can send transactions from the wallet. 5. Ensuring we could get transaction history of wallets efficiently. 6. Creating of tutorials and educational video content for easy user on-boarding embedded into the wallet.

  Our wallet will enable privacy in financial transactions. Our thought process believe it will have a very high level positive impact only on the all the ecosystem participants.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  KPIs: 1. A functioning Zcash wallet for KaiOS feature phones with low specs what the users can use to either store Zcash or transact with their peers. 2. User friendly UI of the wallet to make sure the complexities of creating a wallet is easier for the feature phone users. It will also promote a lot of users to join Zcash ecosystem.
