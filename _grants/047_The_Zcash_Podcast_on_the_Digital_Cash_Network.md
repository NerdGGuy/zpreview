  Fund the creation of a monthly Zcash Podcast, a 60-90 minute live show highlighting news and updates with key figures in Zcash

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The problem/opportunity is described in this thread . Essentially, Zcash has limited visibility and regular content for the community to consume and promote, and as such flies largely under the radar of many public crypto discussions, with more relentlessly-promoted competitors taking up a larger portion of the mind share regarding privacy. I believe that we have the opportunity to begin to address this through regular live long-form podcasts with key figures of the Zcash ecosystem, particularly on channels with existing audiences comprised of fans from the rest of the cryptospace.
- **Proposed solution:**
  I propose the hosting of a regular live Zcash Podcast on my channel Digital Cash Network. This will provide for regular content such as updates, specific subject deep dives, etc. for the existing Zcash community to consume and share, as well as give an opportunity for existing channel subscribers to become more deeply familiar with Zcash. Specifically, this channel focuses on the perspective of living unbanked off of cryptocurrency and decentralizing your whole life, curating a community much more likely to be interested in Zcash's principles and technology compared to the average crypto audience. Additionally, the live format creates a sense of connection with the audience, who are able to participate and ask questions live of the host and guests, ideal for reaching new fans, while still allowing the long-form content to be consumed later.
- **Solution Format:**
  I propose the delivery of a monthly long-format (60-90 minutes, occasionally longer when the guest and subject matter call for it) podcast streamed live on YouTube and Odysee (the LBRY blockchain-based video platform) and appearing later in audio format on Anchor, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, etc. etc. These will be available live on one Friday at 4pm EST and elsewhere immediately after the stream has ended. Included will also be two separate minute-long clips of the podcast to be shared on video channels as well as TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter in order to promote past podcasts.
- **Dependencies:**
  The only external dependency for this project is participation from guests (members of ECC/ZF/greater Zcash community), however this does not have to be explicitly facilitated in order to make this podcast achievable, and I don't foresee significant difficulty in securing guests.
- **Technical approach:**
  My approach to podcasts is guest- and subject-centric, with room for improvisation based on live comment feedback, driven by my own curiosity and passion for decentralized tech and money. An example of this method in action can be seen in the pilot episode of this podcast .

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Joël Valenzuela
- **Background:**
  My name is Joël Valenzuela. I am a crypto user since 2013, and have been living exclusively off of crypto since 2015, and have been a consistent advocate of privacy generally and Zcash specifically for years. I have been working full-time in media and marketing in the cryptospace since then, including writing for Cointelegraph and many years in the Dash DAO with various marketing, media, and adoption projects. I have run a YouTube/Odysee channel/podcast called Digital Cash Network for several years now. Prior to this (and now as part of the channel) I have hosted 196 episodes of the Dash Podcast.

### Funding History

- **Previous funding:**
  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  As mentioned above, securing guests is the only major execution risk I could foresee. The Zcash community appears to be a little more difficult to pin down on interviews than others in the cryptospace, however I can't imagine this being a significant enough obstacle, and I plan to prepare adequately by scheduling guests far in advance and arranging contingencies in case of a lack of availability.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  The only unintended consequences I could speculate may be a result of this project's success would be the discouragement of existing volunteer media projects present in the ecosystem today such as ZecHub . However, I personally believe that the benefits of growing Zcash's media footprint outweigh the potential risks of competing with existing media, and I would work to collaborate with and co-promote existing Zcash-focused media projects and personalities in an attempt to grow the space and its network effects as a whole.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Quantitative: -Output (episodes, clips, social media posts, etc.) -Reach (views, downloads, comments, likes, etc. across all platforms) Qualitative: -Feedback (reviews of the show, anecdotes about learning about Zcash and/or becoming a user/holder, etc.)

### Project Timeline
