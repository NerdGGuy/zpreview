- **Project Summary:**
  Administration of the ZecHub Bounty Program to help it scale

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  ZecHub needs support to continue to grow their successful bounty program. FPF is in a position to assist.
- **Proposed solution:**
  The ZecHub bounty program is ready to scale, and we believe the best way to elevate this program is to partner with the Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF). ZecHub proposes that the bounty funds (500 ZEC + 10% administrative fee) be directly donated to FPF for distribution according to ZecHub’s instructions.This approach offers several benefits: - Increased decentralization - Removal of the current annual earning cap - Simplification of ZecHub’s operations
- **Solution Format:**
  Weekly bounty payouts, along with the associated paperwork/audit trail, will be completed by FPF at the direction of ZecHub.
- **Dependencies:**
  The only dependency is ZecHub providing timely guidance regarding who receives bounties and how much they will receive.
- **Technical approach:**
  Internal payment processes. No real technical aspect per se.

- **Compensation budget:**

  500 ZEC for distribution via the bounty program, 50 for FPF's fee as per prior discussions.

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  FPF Admin
- **Background:**
  The Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF) seeks to address a critical need for operational and financial management support among unincorporated organizations and ad-hoc groups in the cryptocurrency space, with a specific focus on privacy-focused protocols. These organizations, primarily focused on completing technically challenging and innovative products and services, frequently lack the resources to manage their operational and financial affairs effectively. FPF aims to bridge this gap by providing a fully scaled organizational structure and comprehensive back-office support, ensuring these groups can focus on their primary mission and maximize their impact.
