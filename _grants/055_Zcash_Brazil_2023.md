### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The opportunity: Brazil is currently one of the top five countries with the largest number of crypto investors, it has over 10 million users, approximately 5% of the population, behind only India, the US, Russia, and Nigeria. Brazil has passed a law to legalize crypto as a form of payment, and people living in Brazil are very familiar with digital methods for making payments and investments. Also, when you live in Brazil, you see many incentives to buy cryptocurrencies. People living in Brazil do not have much interest in investing in US dollars to do this and protect themselves against inflation. However, you will not see this situation with cryptos. They don’t have to pay such a high tax for cryptocurrencies, making digital currencies a better option than the dollar. We think we have done a great job so far, and in Brazil with CDBC in test, we believe Zcash will make a difference and gain many new users to use ZEC as a payment method, technology, development, new business, etc. — Zcash Brazil could be the Bankless BR for Zcash The problem: The work of Zcash brazil would significantly drop if it was just @michae2xl managing it all. We think part of the pain that Zcash Brazil needs to illustrate in this proposal is that we can’t do this only with @michae2xl and that it needs to be a community effort. NOTE: Zcash brazil today is highlighted among the other Zcash communities, and the team produced everything for only 1000$ monthly, whereas the @michae2xl shared everything with the team and community since begin. Zcash has an amazing technology that needs visibility, and that visibility is limited for now. We at Zcash Brazil are changing the way people see ZEC and showing with new initiatives why privacy is so valuable now tomorrow, and in the future. We need more education, local development, and more active users, and for this we need to keep going to events, creating content regularly for the community to consume and promote. We believe we have the opportunity to start expanding Zcash across all 26 Brazilian states.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Brazil has the most passionate people to accept cryptocurrency, and by market share is the fifth largest country by financial volume. Brazil has a very active, engaged, and growing crypto community. We want to continue and improve the production of marketing content for the Brazilian audience. In this way, we can engage the community and spread our word to potential new members. We would like to continue working together with the global Zcash community and create a bridge and marketing voice in Portuguese to educate people about the Zcash ecosystem and its use cases, bringing improvements, and more. Our current team lives in the biggest cities in Brazil - São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and if approved, we will be the first Zcash ambassador to help the project grow locally with native language support. Benefits: Brazilians have a great interest in cryptocurrencies. Brazil has a fiat depression. CBDC is in the test Brazilian people need privacy, and the government is creating a new system to track people, for example, that ZEC is a fit. Daily updates about Zcash for the Brazilian community. With the budget, we can expand to more states.
- **Solution Format:**
  The format of the work will be: Expansion of Zcash in Brazil. Community management and moderation. Creation and Presence at face-to-face and online events. Interviewing partners, including in English. Creation of content about Zcash and new art made by our design team, in which it is referenced. Active translations of Zcash articles. Creation and participation in podcasts about privacy and Zcash. Presence in the main social media, always aiming to increase the media. AMA creation and participation in AMAs. Delivering items to the community like TIPs in ZEC, POAPs, and giveaways in general. Creation of Articles about Zcash Creation of Events to teach new people about Zcash See some of the previous work: https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1565416047649460224 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1597250440823177216 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1566171129047384067 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1545203024192307204 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1528444294469718019 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1556024151068082183 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1599469744603934720 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1528114661706571776 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1594105495920562184 https://youtu.be/slB6F63vsZo https://youtu.be/R3thfsZdsag https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slB6F63vsZo&t=238s https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1587557786870751233 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1569436191505715202 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1585992577920245761 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1539630383456829447 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1527763943510401024 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1577825377241677825 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1565800981262225409 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1566169019987759105 https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1513577636794183695 https://odysee.com/@zechubr:c https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil/status/1600135271751696384 https://discord.gg/zcash https://twitter.com/ZecHub https://twitter.com/zcashbrazil
