- **Project Summary:**
  Summary and Note taking of Arborist calls for community members to stay up to date on protocol research & implementation

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The Zcash Arborist Calls are bi-weekly protocol development meetings live streamed via YouTube focused on tracking upcoming protocol deployment logistics, consensus node implementation issues, and protocol research for up to 1.5hrs. To overcome the lack of accessibility about the key decision points and actions discussed during the calls which may become challenging for non-technical listeners or simply due to time constraints for the listener, a concise summation of the meeting can be composed and made available on a social platform that allows comments, shares & sentiment to be gauged.
- **Proposed solution:**
  As the Zcash community & particularly the general public may find the level of technical detail a barrier to having a complete understanding of the points discussed during the Arborist calls, a complimentary format is therefore desirable. Digestible segments in summarised form detailing key protocol decision points and actions will be beneficial to the community serving also as historical record of the calls including relevant links, Twitter usernames or other resources. Additionally this helps build transparency into protocol development while promoting opportunities for community members to participate.
- **Solution Format:**
  Twitter/Github summary posts with full notes and links to timestamps or other resources.
- **Dependencies:**
  Arborist calls and availability of social media account(s)
- **Technical approach:**
  During the Live call, notes are taken covering all points discussed. Once the call is complete full notes will be written and published. Concise summary of any actions & key developmental topics raised will be posted to Twitter as a thread containing relevant links/hashtags and screenshots where applicable.

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Jason Rogers
- **Background:**
  Experience providing immediate Technical Support for a Satellite Telecoms company. 2+ years Professional Audio Transcription for Rev.com. Capable of writing with consistent grammatical accuracy, ownership of workload and prompt delivery of projects within a given time-frame. With a strong grasp of Zcash, having a general understanding the protocol, zk-SNARK’s and their components as well as some experience using Zcashd and knowledge of the planned upgrades, the Community Note-Takers duty presents an excellent chance to gain valuable experience covering the fascinating and critical steps in development as they occur. Long-standing interest in some of the community supported projects such as ZECPages & other projects outside of Zcash such as Locha Mesh, Blockstream Satellite and Global Mesh Labs. Such initiatives are vitally important and require greater attention. With a keen awareness of the beneficial social impacts of Zcash and the ongoing hard work from all the people involved, any opportunity to get involved and spread the word would be monumental.
