- **Project Summary:**
  zkApe ü§ùZcash - Sponsored Turkish Newsletter and Marketing Campaign

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Problem Problems Low awareness in Turkish crypto community of Zcash. Low awareness of the Zcash ZK technology. Lack of knowledge about the importance of zero knowledge technologies. Lack of Zcash Turkish-speaking community Language barrier In order to overcome all these shortcomings, we must start the marketing activity. This is a great opportunity and the Turkish speaking community is huge in the entire crypto universe. Solution Description : Grant will be used to sponsor an existing Turkish newsletter with Zcash messaging and a few dedicated posts explaining Zcash tech and benefits. The grant will also include marketing across Twitter campaigns, promotions and general engagement across the Turkish community. Purpose : This grant will help expand and promote the use of Zcash in the Turkish crypto community, an already very active group in crypto that can continue expanding. By sponsoring the newsletter and campaigning Zcash, we hope to grow the base of Turkish users.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Execution : 6 month period including 12 newsletters, 6 twitter threads, and Turkish language video tutorial Channels : Twitter, Substack, Telegram Target Group : DeFi users, mid level crypto users
- **Solution Format:**
  The final output created is the content and serves as a guide for any user new to Zcash. I aim to reach new people and potential Zcash users with content. In addition, this communication activity will serve to increase the awareness of Zcash.
- **Dependencies:**
  No external dependencies are required. It will be quite enough for me to reach the Zcash team and get feedback if needed
- **Technical approach:**
  The basic approach in the communication process is to present non-misleading content to increase the awareness of the readers. The timing of the newsletter is pretty clear. Newsletter is shared twice a month (the beginning of the month and the middle of the month) In addition to the existing zkApe content, Zcash developments are featured more prominently. Also, the content level will increase with the Zcash forum and the team's information feed. If we briefly detail the process; repeated every 15 days preparing a content list for the newsletter Adding Zcash developments and feature introduction, for example how to contents Draft completion and Q&A process Proofreading Publishing Distribution and announcement on social media accounts Answering questions or directing them to the team

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The most unknown factor may be my death. If there is no problem other than a health problem, this process will work.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  The biggest output will be the increase in awareness of Zcash in a community where it is not involved at all. This proposal contains awareness, new users, a new community and a lot of potential for the next step.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  The reach and interaction of the content included in the newsletter can give a good idea for measurement. In addition, the access and interaction numbers of the content shared on Twitter are also important. some of the zcash content I shared before https://zkape.substack.com/p/zkape-19?s=w https://zkape.substack.com/p/zkape-18?s=w https://zkape.substack.com/p/zkape-17?s=w https://zkape.substack.com/p/zkape-16?s=w https://zkape.substack.com/p/zkape-11?s=w https://zkape.substack.com/p/zkape-6?s=w https://zkape.substack.com/p/zkape-3?s=w
