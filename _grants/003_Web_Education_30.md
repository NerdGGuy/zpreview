- **Project Summary:**
  Zcash in Brazil: A website and videos teaching all about ZCash

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  The general public is not familiar with Zcash, zero-knowledge proofs, the Zcash community, or how Zcash and its technology. In addition to the problem of general lack of awareness about privacy and how it can impact our lives with cryptocurrencies, Brazilians have an even greater need to know this technology because we live in a highly regulated country with little freedom. Finally, although information and discussions about the development of Zcash are at a high level in English-speaking forums, little is said here and little is known.
- **Proposed solution:**
  The purpose of the project is to bring ZCash to Brazil and create a website where we will bring updates, articles, translations of technical and non-technical documents and create a series of videos teaching how to use ZCash STEP BY STEP. I want to use the knowledge in web 3.0 + marketing and bring the best content so that the 220 million Brazilians can have access. I am going to create a free, simple language videos and content for common users, educating about ZCash ecosystem, Privacy and Web 3.0. Through free content on YouTube channel and a new Website (zcashbrasil.org), I will educate new people how to start in Web 3.0 with Privacy. This helps the entire blockchain ecosystem, which is just in its infancy. Also, through my website and youtube channel I will be able to further expand the impact of the videos, creating a category/playlist for Privacy and Security. https://fitpro.games/ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeUOdzVdurg0q72Yy7nMNMQ
- **Solution Format:**
  Website
- **Dependencies:**
  A small risk of delay with the translation of documents and editions, but we don't see this as a big problem
- **Technical approach:**
  Let's create the entire site structure with the appropriate categories Start translating key documents, articles and news Constantly update with updates that come out on the official website Structure video scripts Create videos and post Also post updates on our main channel to reach even more people – Our channel is focused on Web 3.0 Education

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Jian Costa
- **Background:**
  I am from Brazil and I am an Entrepreneur, business creator since 2013. Graduated in Mechanical Engineering, my passion has always been business and getting ideas off paper. I created some businesses, invested in others, made mistakes in others. It took me a while to set my eyes on crypto as I was focused on other businesses. When I got to know it, I fell in love and since then, I just see myself working with it and building everything related to it. In 2018 I created a digital marketing agency to sell courses in Brazil focusing on content marketing. We invested a lot in Facebook and Google ads during this period and we have the knowledge to reach the right customers through these platforms. I am part of a group that studies various protocols/blockchains. I knew ZCash there and I can find documents and news about the project only in English. There is almost nothing about the protocol in Portuguese and I want to share this with other people. I know the power of education, community and business creation around Web 3.0 and Privacy. And I want to teach that to Brazilians.

### Funding History

  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  Our proposal is not coding or technical in nature, so we don't see major risks.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  I cannot see anything
- **Evaluation plan:**
  We will have the main information channel about Zcash, privacy and security in cryptocurrencies in Brazil. The greater the growth of the protocol, the more information will be brought to the site and we will be able to measure the number of monthly visits and interest/searches for the word ZCASH by google. Through the videos we will be able to know the number of views and of course, likes.
