  An interview podcast diving into the role of shielded transactions in protecting human rights and the future of decentralized finance.

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Problem/opportunity: Privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies and the ecosystem that they enable may experience a significant crackdown across the US soon. This is happening as China is rolling out its surveillance-friendly central bank digital currency, potentially making its use a condition for economic agreements with weaker international economic partners. How serious or urgent of a need: Given regulatory speed, a crackdown on private coins that is "soon" may mean 2-5 years but by then we need a strong global public awareness that privacy is crucial for US and global consumers. The Chinese surveillance-friendly digital currency expansion will likely be faster. What evidence do you have: Recent US House of representatives hearings that were suggestive of limiting actions on cryptocurrencies. China is continuing to push its digital yuan pilots: https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/where-does-chinas-digital-currency-stand/
- **Proposed solution:**
  Describe the solution at a high level: keynote seminars turned into podcast that establishes public awareness that the ability to cooperate privately is central to human freedom and crucial to enable a variety of communities to live flourishing lives. This aligns with the "media, narrative, and policy advocacy" stakeholder segment on the ZOMG whitepaper ( https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zomg/blob/master/whitepaper/ZOMG_whitepaper_v1.0_published.pdf ) Please be specific about who the users and stakeholders are and how they would interact with your solution: stakeholders who stand to benefit: US and global consumers at large, DeFi, and privacy-preserving currencies in particular
- **Solution Format:**
  What is the exact form of the deliverable you’re creating? interviews with top privacy/ human rights activists, regulators, DeFi projects, consumers, and more on why shielded interactions should be a crucial part of our lives, and what we risk by giving them up. Topics we may cover include: Why the global public should care: Global human rights activism that benefits from shielded transactions Why the US govt should care: How non-shielded transactions lead to national security concerns vis a vis exploitation of US by external attackers Why consumers should care: How future mass traffic analysis can lead to physical extortability of anyone who ever transacted using public blockchains Why entrepreneurs should care: How public blockchains can enable anti-competitive behavior, e.g. by allowing the next Amazon to analyze the world’s transactions in detail to clobber rising products Why DeFi should care: Major losses in DeFi due to bots doing traffic analysis of major public transactions on exchanges to frontrun them Why the crypto ecosystem should care: Previously impossible cooperative arrangements enabled by zk, e.g. how recursive HALO zk proofs could enable scalable DEXs
- **Dependencies:**
  The public may end up not caring about their ability to interact freely despite strong reasons and narrative to the contrary.
- **Technical approach:**
  Keynote seminars will be virtual, allowing high global live attendance and easy editing as a well-produced podcast

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Foresight Institute

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  The public may end up not caring about their ability to interact freely despite strong reasons and narrative to the contrary.
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  Shielded interactions, in general, may have unintended consequences, e.g. by enabling entities to centralize power in unobservable ways.
- **Evaluation plan:**
  mainstream media referencing podcast public opinion polls on privacy and private cryptocurrencies improving charities and dissidents accepting Zcash Every podcast episode will be followed by an action item, running a Zcash node, installing a private wallet, donating to a charity using Zcash etc. Some of these may even be trackable via zk-proofs, which would be a fun meta-way to validate success.
