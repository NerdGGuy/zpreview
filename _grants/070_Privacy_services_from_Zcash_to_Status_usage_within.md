### Project Overview

- **Project Name:**
  Privacy services from Zcash to Status usage within the Ukrainian-Russian war (research)
- **Last Updated:**

- **Project Summary:**
  Research on how private web3-solutions are used within the Ukrainian-Russian war (with a focus on privacy-protecting currencies like Zcash).

### Project Description

- **Overview:**
  Privacy services like Zcash still lack practical & explicit use cases when they save lives or increase personal protection.
- **Proposed solution:**
  Report full of use cases (practical & potential) on how privacy services (top use case - Zcash) could empower human rights. A "full privacy stack" would be created with Zcash as an important use case (because privacy currencies could be applicable from volunteers to NGOs). Accessible for not professionals, so it can be shared with ease by - ambassadors - moderators - crypto influencers - journalists - human rights activists & other people.
- **Solution Format:**
  Git-Hub friendly research: - static file PDF - basic wiki (full report) - use cases (similar to UX/UI personas)
- **Dependencies:**
  No dependencies.
- **Technical approach:**
  1. Pagency framework is at the core of research. 2. This AccessNow reference is my direction (plus full of UX/UI alike personas).

### Team Members

- **Project Lead:**
  Mykola Siusko
- **Background:**
  Ethical CMO. For 10 years I was serving surveillance capitalism working in advertising agencies, facilitating campaigns from Coca-Cola to Mastercard (5 years in leadership). LinkedIn . For 5 years helping blockchain tech decentralise legacy systems: Apla Blockchain (clients: Ajman Emirate, oil companies, Huawei), DEIP (part of the NEAR ecosystem) among others. In 2022 moved to privacy-market: delivered the biggest privacy-enhancing services database at GitHub, made Pagency privacy-services ideation framework, created ZK services database, developing scoring model for privacy services' assesment.

### Funding History

- **Previous funding:**
  No
- **Other funding sources:**
  No

### Risks and Evaluation

- **Execution risks:**
  Feedback & interviews could take time, especially within sensitive conditions. Some people would need more time to share sensitive data (like using privacy coins like Zcash).
- **Unintended Consequences:**
  Education takes time. So even if people in need of Zcash would read &/or found out about the report - they will spend quite a while using it (give it a try).
- **Evaluation plan:**
  Quantitative : 1 report delivered to the community & published publicly on a GitHub Qualitative : - applicability of the data (findings should be accessible to Zcash ambassadors, privacy experts, and journalists) - a variety of use cases for Zcash (broad range of use-cases)
