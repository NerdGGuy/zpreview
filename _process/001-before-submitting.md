title: Before Submitting Your Application
---

<span style="color:#f8a600">Be aware of the following before submitting your application:</span>

- Review our [Grant Categories](/categories) page to understand the types of projects we fund.
- Approved applicants will need to go through a KYC process to be eligible for funding, though they can remain pseudonymous to the public.
- Applications can be submitted on a rolling basis, but will be reviewed every other week.
- The larger the requested sum, the more diligence and milestones required
- See our home page for a list of things we're ready to fund, but keep in mind this list is not all inclusive and we would love to hear your ideas!
- Not sure if you're ready to submit an application? Have questions? Feel free to post your idea to the forums in the [Grants category](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/grants/33) to solicit feedback. You can tag @ZcashGrants in your post to ask the Committee questions.
