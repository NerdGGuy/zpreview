# Grants Platform

This repository manages our grants program. Here's how it works:

1. Applicants submit a grant application by creating a new issue using the provided template.
2. Reviewers assess the applications and label approved ones with 'approved'.
3. Approved applications are automatically converted into pull requests.
4. Once merged, approved grants appear on our [Grants Website](https://NerdGGuy.github.io/GGrants).

## For Applicants

To apply for a grant, [create a new issue](../../issues/new?template=grant_application.md) using the grant application template.

## For Reviewers

To approve a grant:
1. Review the grant application issue.
2. If approved, move the issue to the "Approved" column on the project board.
3. A pull request will be automatically created.
4. Review and merge the pull request to publish the approved grant.
